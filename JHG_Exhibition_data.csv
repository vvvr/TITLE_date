During this time, the Gallery was marked by a consistent and focused programme, an element of which explored the legacy of the early conceptual art movement and its influence on succeeding generations of artists. Embracing the Gallery�۪s unique position within the University, new commissions were often created through mutually beneficial collaborations between artists and academics from a wide variety of disciplines. In 2018, after 39-years on Highfield campus, John Hansard Gallery relocated to a new purpose-built city centre space in Southampton�۪s Guildhall Square. Bridging both its previous and new city centre homes, Time After Time re-examines some key site-specific installations that were shown at the Gallery between 1993 and 2016 by artists Caroline Bergvall, Victor Burgin, Hamad Butt, John Latham, Charlotte Posenenske, alongside a new work by Walter van Rijn. By remaking these works, the pragmatics of reimagining the ���original�۪ temporary installation and the significance of ���site�۪ are explored. The exhibition Time After Time examines the long-term value of what are often initially conceived as temporary or transient works, helping to link the original John Hansard Gallery location with its new city centre home. The exhibition explores the nature of site-specificity in various ways, some of the works represented for Time After Time were made to be preserved, some have been adapted from earlier presentations, and some have been reimagined from their original showings. Time After Time has been made possible through the generous support of the Henry Moore Foundation, who have also supported John Hansard Gallery�۪s exhibitions programme over many years, including some of the original exhibitions revisited for Time After Time.",5508; 5509; 5510; 5511; 5512; 5513; 5514; 5515; 5516; 5517; 5518; 5519; 5520; 5521; 5522; 5523; 5524; 5525; 5526; 5527; 5528; 5529; 5530; 5531; 5532; 5533; 5534; 5535; 5536; 5537; 5538; 5539; 5540; 5541; 5542; 5543; 5544; 5545; 5546; 5547; 5548; 5549; 5550; 5551; 5552; 5553; 5554; 5555; 5556; 5557; 5558; 5559; 5560; 5561; 5562; 5563; 5564; 5565; 5566; 5567; 5568; 5569; 5570; 5571; 5572; 5573; 5574

Organised by Hayward Touring at Southbank Centre, London, and taking place every five years, it introduces a broad public to a new generation of artists.��Curated by Anna Colin and Lydia Yee, British Art Show 8 features the work of 42 artists who have made a significant contribution to art in this country over the past five years. The result of the curators�۪ research across the UK and beyond is a wide-ranging exhibition that encompasses sculpture, film, video-installation, photography, painting, performance and design. Twenty-six of the artists have created new works especially for the exhibition, making this the most ambitious British Art Show to date.��A central concern of British Art Show 8 is the changing role and status of the object at a time of increasing convergence between the real and the virtual. In response to this condition artists have developed new ways of thinking about, and approaching, materiality. While some revisit traditional craft-based skills or make use of industrial techniques, others use data as a starting point for their work, or investigate the material conditions of our digital existence. Within the exhibition ordinary objects ��� a car, a hard drive or an egg ��� are considered as archaeological finds or narrative devices. Operating within a complex web of relationships, these objects reveal new ways of being, thinking and acting in the world.British Art Show 8 will be presented in Southampton at John Hansard Gallery and Southampton City Art Gallery, as well as off-site locations including the iconic Bargate Monument, a Grade I listed medieval gatehouse in the city centre of Southampton��and at the University of Southampton's Highfield Campus.��John Hansard Gallery artists:John Akomfrah & Trevor Mathison / Adam Broomberg & Oliver Chanarin / Melanie Gilligan / Ahmet ��g�_t (with Susan Hiller) / Will Holder / Patrick Staff / Imogen Stidworthy /Stuart WhippsSouthampton City Art Gallery artists:��b�_ke / Lawrence Abu Hamdan / Caroline Achaintre / Aaron Angell / Pablo Bronstein / Andrea B�_ttner / Alexandre da Cunha / Nicolas Deshayes / Benedict Drew / Simon Fujiwara / Anthea Hamilton / Martino Gamper / Ryan Gander / Alan Kane / Mikhail Karikis / Linder / Rachel Maclean / Ahmet ��g�_t (with Liam Gillick) / Yuri Pattison / Ciara Phillips / Charlotte Prodger / Laure Prouvost / Magali Reus / James Richards / Daniel Sinsel / Cally Spooner / Hayley Tompkins / Jesse Wine / Jessica Warboys / Bedwyr Williams / Lynette Yiadom-BoakyeOff-Site: Bargate MonumentEileen Simpson & Ben White��Off-Site: University of Southampton, HighfieldAhmet ��g�_t (with Goshka Macuga)",3872; 3873; 3874; 3875; 3876; 3877; 3878; 3879; 3880; 5469

The influence of Barthes on Burgin�۪s work is well documented, not least by Burgin himself. Equally, Burgin�۪s prominence as an artist and theorist concerned with text and image during the 1970s onwards offers a challenging dialogue with Barthes�۪ work.Roland Barthes�۪ writings continue to resonate with literary and arts scholarship today, yet the fact that Barthes sustained a practice of drawing and painting throughout the 1970s is little known. Only a handful of other public displays have occurred outside of France, but they have never been previously shown in the UK, despite sustained interest in his writings.Since the 1960s, Victor Burgin has been one of the leading Conceptual artists and theorists from the UK working internationally. Often concerned with architecture, space, the built environment, memory and the means by which memory is physically and technologically constructed, Burgin�۪s recent digital projection installations can be considered as ���photographs that move�۪. These works are not video as such, nor photography, but deliberate, painstaking digital constructions using current technologies.Barthes/Burgin is a John Hansard Gallery exhibition, devised and curated in partnership with Professor Ryan Bishop and Dr Sunil Manghani, Winchester School of Art.

2015_12_THE_TREMBLING,2015,03/12/2015,23/01/2016,Aura Satz: The Trembling Line,Aura Satz,37,"The Trembling Line is an exhibition by Aura Satz exploring acoustics, vibration, sound visualisation and musical gesture with an aim to wrest the space between sound and image to see how far these can be stretched apart before they fold back into one another. The title, The Trembling Line, refers in part to the basic principle of vibration, a disturbance of equilibrium, such as the stimulated of motion and sound through friction, but also to the possibility of challenging static notation systems and destabilizing the experience of seeing and hearing.The centrepiece of the show is the film and sound installation The Trembling Line, which explores visual and acoustic echoes between decipherable musical gestures and abstract patterning, orchestral swells and extreme slow-motion close-ups of strings and percussion. It features a score by Leo Grant and an innovative multichannel audio system by the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR), University of Southampton, as part of the S3A research project on immersive listening.��The exhibition includes The Absorbing Wall (2015), based on an anechoic chamber, along with five closely inter-connected films: Vocal Flame (2012); Oramics: Atlantis Anew (2011); Onomatopoeic Alphabet (2010); Theremin (2009); Automamusic (2008).��Some of the works address the visualisation of sound as a morphing language in which patterns of sand, salt or fire correspond to sounds in unexpected ways. Others address gesture-less mechanical music or the compelling gesturality of a theremin, a sensitive instrument that is played without physical contact, merely by waving hands in its proximity, affecting the sounds produced by the electromagnetic field.��The Trembling Line is the result of Aura Satz�۪s year as Artist-in-Residence at the University of Southampton, funded by The Leverhulme Trust and the University.",18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24

With special thanks to the Malcolm McLaren Estate, the John McCready Archive at Liverpool John Moores University, and to the numerous lenders and individuals who have generously provided permissions and lent works and archival material.From Situationism to Beat to Punk, Eyes For Blowing Up Bridges unites a group of remarkable radical artists, poets, writers and activists who initiated, perpetrated and influenced a range of seminal post-war alternative movements.Presenting rarely exhibited material ��� including cut-ups, film, video, sound and slide, as well as self-published books, pamphlets, anarchist propaganda, punk ephemera and graphics ��� the exhibition examines the creative interplay between William Burroughs, Guy Debord, Asger Jorn, Alexander Trocchi and King Mob, and their collective influence on Malcolm McLaren in his endeavours to disrupt the cultural and social status quo from the 1960s to his premature death in 2010.Malcolm McLaren co-opted the intellectual vigour of this powerful and difficult group of individuals to make insurrectionary statements during his days as a Situationist art student in the 1960s, to the end of his life in groundbreaking artistic forays expressed through pop culture (fashion, music, environment, performance, film).Having repudiated painting as a bourgeois form of expression like Asger Jorn before him, McLaren�۪s lifelong work was inspired by such Situationist techniques as d̩tournement (the juxtaposition of pre-existing elements), Burroughs�۪ ���cut-ups�۪, and Debord�۪s emphasis on the staging of situations ���that bring a revolutionary reordering of life, politics and art�۝. Eyes For Blowing Up Bridges will present representations of the ���defiguration�۝ paintings exhibited by Jorn in the early 1960s, alongside the detourned comic strips of the Situationist International�۪s literature and Debord�۪s cinematic masterpiece, The Society Of The Spectacle.McLaren resurrected slogans associated with radical group King Mob, and their commentary on the banalisation of everyday life by the consumer society in the late 1960s. He also lifted text from the porn novels Alexander Trocchi wrote for the Olympia Press in the preceding decade. Original volumes of the revolutionary group�۪s King Mob Echo will be on display in the exhibition, which will also highlight the links between Trocchi�۪s book Helen And Desire and McLaren�۪s t-shirts design entitled ���I Groaned With Pain�۪.Original volumes of the revolutionary group King Mob's Echo will be on display, along with McLaren's tribute to Debord et al with the film installations Shallow 1-21 and Paris, Capital of the XXIst Century. The exhibition features the first UK public display of representations of McLaren�۪s student work from Goldsmiths College, along with material from the Malcolm McLaren Estate archive, including notes, sketches, and personal items.The title of the exhibition is derived from the phrase, ���de beaux yeux pour faire sauter des ponts�۝, taken from correspondence between Guy Debord and his friend Herv̩ Falcou, 1949-53.Eyes For Blowing Up Bridges is a John Hansard Gallery exhibition curated by David Thorp and Paul Gorman.

Comprising films, neon works, sculpture, and a newly commissioned large-scale textile painting, Dawood�۪s practice operates somewhere between the real and the surreal, often creating a dialogue between two worlds and two realities, both past and present.Appropriating many of his ideas from modern European and American aesthetics, Dawood generates a critical examination of identity. His travels and conclusive research, coupled with his interest in the fantastical, all inform his ever-evolving imagination and feed into the unusual and intriguing narratives included in his filmwork and beyond.��Shezad Dawood works across a broad spectrum of media and his works have been exhibited in solo and group shows in the UK and internationally, including ICA, Taipei Biennial, Marrakech Biennial, MACBA Barcelona, MoMA PS1, Witte de With, Modern Art Oxford, Busan Biennale, Tate Britain and the Venice Biennale.A John Hansard Gallery exhibition, curated in collaboration with Camilla Palestra, Shezad Dawood Studio.Towards the Possible Film (2014) was commissioned by Film and Video Umbrella and Delfina Foundation.",115; 116; 117; 118; 119; 120; 121; 122

The group show includes artists whose work utilises material intrinsic to their practice, and those whose contemporary ideals harness those of key Modernist architects, such as Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. Truth to materials, a tenet of modern architecture, underpins the exhibition and prioritises material as function to often heighten the meaning or essence of an object.Material elements are paramount to the work of artists Alice Channer, Ian Kiaer, Kitty Kraus, Phillip Lai and Bojan Sarcevic, with each artist identifying with the material�۪s materiality. Either in the changing state of a substance, or arrangement of material elements, notions of architectural and modernist ideals thread through An Intervention.The title, An Intervention, addresses the very nature of the works; each piece intercedes the gallery space and, through subtle means, arrests the viewer to stop and consider the space both the visitor and work occupy.",123; 124; 125; 126; 127; 128; 129; 130; 131; 132; 133; 5496
2015_3_UNMADE_FILM,2015,03/03/2015,25/04/2015,Uriel Orlow: Unmade Film,Uriel Orlow,552,"Unmade Film is an ambitious body of work by Uriel Orlow shown for the first time in its entirety in the UK. The work takes the form of an impossible film, fragmented into its constituent parts. An expansive collection of audio-visual works that point to the structure of a film but never fully become one, Unmade Film takes as its starting point the emblematic yet wholly invisible Palestinian village of Deir Yassin, formerly on the outskirts of Jerusalem. The multi-part work evolved out of long-term research and collaborations with actors, musicians, pupils and psychologists in East Jerusalem and Ramallah.In April 1948, a month before the planned partition of Palestine, Deir Yassin was attacked by two Zionist paramilitary groups and over 100 villagers were brutally killed. The massacre of Deir Yassin is considered to be one of the pivotal events that led to the exodus of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from other towns and villages. In 1951 a mental hospital, Kfar Sha�۪ul, was established on the grounds of Deir Yassin, incorporating the buildings that remained intact after the massacre. Initially treating Holocaust survivors, the psychiatric clinic is today also known for treating and researching the so-called ���Jerusalem Syndrome�۪.Orlow first got to know the mental hospital Kfar Sha�۪ul as a child on trips from Switzerland, when he visited a great aunt who was treated there. She had survived Auschwitz and was sent to Palestine after the war, where she eventually suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized at the clinic for thirty years, until her death.��In Unmade Film, Orlow probes the entangled history and spatial layering of the Holocaust and the Nakba and addresses conflicting narratives without comparing them. Working across sound, drawing, video, text and photography and referencing Robert Smithson and Pier Paolo Pasolini amongst others, Orlow takes the viewer on a journey through the medium of film and produces a fragmented narrative of space and time that questions the circumstances of obliterated geo-histories and their continued impact in the present. Unmade Film exposes itself to absence and impossible representation, producing unsettled new meanings in complicity with the viewers of the work.The exhibition is accompanied by a publication edited by Andrea Thal and Uriel Orlow and published by Edition Fink, Zurich, with texts by Erik Bullot, Yoa�۪d Ghanadry, Avery Gordon, Esmail Nashif, Ilan Papp̩, Hanan Toukan, Andrea Thal and Uriel Orlow, and support from Pro Helvetia.",134; 135; 136; 137; 138; 139; 140; 141
2014_12_TERMINAL_BLUE,2014,09/12/2014,07/02/2015,Tom Dale: Terminal Blue,Tom Dale,545,"Over recent years Tom Dale has produced a body of work for both galleries and public spaces, bringing to both the same dexterity and questioning vision. Terminal Blue will concentrate on the following pieces, two of which are important works in the development of his practice that are for the first time, to be fully realised, as well as one set of works that have been commissioned especially for John Hansard Gallery.Terminal Blue - the title work of the exhibition - forms the first part of the show, uniting art specifics, as much of Dale�۪s work does, such as questions of scale and definition, with more phenomenological ones. The piece is partially participatory, consisting of a banner being flown across the sky by plane in the form of a giant-sized colour swatch that details the shift from dark blue to light blue. Seen across the skyline at a specific time, details and a copy of the colour swatch, including the commercial paints names of the colours, will be printed in the local press giving people in the city the opportunity to make a comparison with the swatch and sky that day.Another work is Infinity Wall, an apparatus that enables the gallery space to continually record, produce and destroy its own memory in real time. The printed images, which will emerge from one of the gallery walls, only to be shredded minutes later, will accumulate in the space over the duration of the exhibition leaving the detritus of its own memory to mingle with the other works in the show.��Key to the exhibition will be an important new body of work which will occupy the central gallery space. A series of sculptures will take their cue from an earlier series of digital images, and, like the two central commissions, these objects will in their own way seek to make sense of the changing dynamics between interior/exterior space which Dale sees as something born out of the impact of digital and virtual space.A fully illustrated publication produced in partnership with Nicosia Municipal Arts Centre in Cyprus will accompany Terminal Blue, with a contribution from the writer Brian Dillon, curator of the recent Ruin Lust exhibition at Tate Britain, and Jon Wood, Research Curator at The Henry Moore Institute.

His focus has always remained on the markers at either end of conflict; the preparation manifested in toys, games, stories of the heroic, and the commemoration of the dead in the proliferation of public monuments.In this Centenary Year, amidst a renewed public interest in WW1, Anstee is looking back over past works and questioning the narrative in-between.Enchantment of Distance, in Level 4 Gallery, Hartley Library at the University of Southampton, forms part of a larger proposal for winter 2015 centred on the Edwin Lutyens Memorial in Southampton�۪s Watts Park, the first and largest of Lutyens Cenotaph structures in the UK. Work in the Level 4 Gallery show includes conceptual drawings from this ongoing proposal, and observational and imagined studies produced over the last decade from residencies undertaken, such as the Stonehenge Riverside Project. Also showing is the short film, Encounter, a durational drawing piece for In Flanders Fields Museum, Belgium, a project which saw Anstee singularly mark out two opposing armies of equal numbers either side of a four metre wall over 72 days.Continuing the durational drawing, also present are panels from the live drawing RedBlueRedBlue, recently commissioned by the Imperial War Museum. Every day the artist drew a reaction to the previous day, with visitors able to follow a virtual battle as each force tries to outmanoeuvre each other. As the drawings accumulated over a thirty day period, the interior of Imperial War North transformed into a giant kaleidoscope of red and blue, creating an immersive installation that challenged audiences to think about their perceptions of war.Enchantment of Distance forms part of the University of Southampton�۪s Great War: Unknown War programme - a series of events, talks, workshops and conferences taking place in 2014-15 across campus, as part of the wider global WW1 commemoration.

The exhibition charts how the financial world has been imagined in art, illustration, photography and other visual media over the last three centuries in Britain and the United States, and asks how artists have tussled with the intangible nature of money; from the South Sea Bubble of the eighteenth century to the global financial crisis of 2008.��The exhibition showcases many works created since the 2008 financial crash, including Molly Crabapple�۪s surrealist oil painting Debt and Her Debtors (2012-13), through to Goldin+Senneby�۪s installation Headless (2008), detailing the search for an offshore company that forms the basis for a ghost-written novel commissioned by the artists. There is a new version of Simon Roberts�۪ Credit Crunch Lexicon (2012), a wall-based text work that alphabetically lists words and phrases collated from political speeches, Bank of England papers, newspaper headlines and economic reports as a vehicle for political comment.��Other works include Zurich artist Robin Bhattacharya�۪s installation The Robin Currency��, featuring a fully functioning currency system, Thomas Gokey�۪s $49,983: total amount of money rendered in exchange for a Master of Fine Art Degree to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, pulped into four sheets of paper (2012), a work that the artist then sells himself for $5 per square inch,��while Rhiannon Williams�۪ My Loss Is My Loss (2010-11) comprises a patchwork quilt of lottery tickets purchased over a decade highlighting blighted investment.John Hansard Gallery sees a new commission by Cornford & Cross. Exploring the workings of ���the market�۪ by drawing on natural and technological metaphors, these eerily beautiful prints, titled Lost Horizon, create a three-dimensional landscape that dramatizes the virtualisation of money. The work draws on financial data conducted with London School of Economics and American Express, with the artists employing CGI software to visualise fantasy landscapes, echoing the way traders now engage with the market through their trading screens.Show Me the Money: The Image of Finance 1700 to the Present is initiated and curated by Peter Knight, Manchester University, Nicky Marsh, University of Southampton, Paul Crosthwaite, Edinburgh University and Isabella Streffen, Oxford Brookes University.

Brimfield offers a world filled with humour, pathos and, at times, painfully accurate observations of the routines of the everyday world. Second-hand anecdotes, monologues and mythologies surrounding performers and their performances are expanded, distorted and completely supplanted by new fictions, with archival photographs and footage being appropriated and re-contextualised, or entirely invented at will.Famous names facing re-invention include artist Jackson Pollock and Hollywood-dweller Ed Harris, with Brimfield�۪s cohort ��� including��Dickie Beau, David Cann, Esther Coles and Joanna Neary - presenting a composite portrait of ���great artists�۪ revealed through a variety of clich̩s.

Both artists, through their distinctive practices, have made new works exploring their interests in how cultural archetypes and ideas interweave with science and technology to create new shapes, visual forms and structure.As we develop the tools to manipulate and engineer new forms and systems of life, the exhibition considers our historical and contemporary entanglements with nature, technology and the economy, and how these relationships influence emergent forms in biological and synthetic matter, through new sculpture, installation and moving image works.The Urpflanze (Part 2) is the second part of��Melanie Jackson�۪s ongoing investigation into mutability and transformation that takes its lead from Goethe�۪s concept of an imaginary primal plant, the��Urpflanze, that contained coiled up within it the potential to unfurl all possible future forms. Contemporary science likewise imagines the potential to grow or print any form we can imagine, by recasting physical, chemical and biological function as a substrate that can be programmed into being. Jackson�۪s work begins in the botanical garden and looks to the laboratory, from clay pits to the factory floor, from analogue to digital clay, from its own animated pixels to the interior of the screen in a series of moving image works and ceramic sculptures. She has collaborated with Esther Leslie on a text that has informed the work and a new publication, The��UR-Phenomenon,��that will be distributed as part of the exhibition.In��Kingyo Kingdom,��Revital Cohen, whose projects often test the ethical parameters of biological design, explores the genus of fish that have been designed for aesthetic purposes, questioning the definitions used to indicate living creatures. Does one denominate a manipulated organism as an object, product, animal or pet? What consequences does this entail for our feelings and behaviours? Cohen�۪s interest in the cultural perceptions and aesthetics of animal-as-product took her to Japan where exotic goldfish have been developed over centuries of meticulous cultivation; breeding out dorsal fins and sculpting kimono-like Ranchu fish tails.��Kingyo Kingdom��explores the unique culture of breeders, collectors and connoisseurs with footage from the Japanese national goldfish competition, questioning the design and commodification of this species.Transformism��is commissioned by��The Arts Catalyst��and organised in partnership with the John Hansard Gallery.

Artists presented in this exhibition are interested in making works that interact with social life and challenge the notion of ���art for art�۪s sake�۪.The exhibition comprises a selection of video pieces from 1920s Russia to the present day conflict in Palestine/ Israel. Whether through personal stories, re-contextualising events or by simply bearing witness, these works directly address social and political realities. The question that remains is how to prevent these aesthetic presentations from becoming just another commodity removed from their reference point by sitting comfortably in a gallery space?An off-site John Hansard Gallery exhibition at John Hansard Gallery Central.",1355; 1356; 1357; 1358; 1359; 1360; 1361; 1362; 1363; 1924

There is something of the guerrilla action about his work ��� ephemeral, quietly subversive and totally committed. Smith's work has its roots in European and American conceptualism, acknowledging artists such as John Cage, Joseph Beuys and Bruce Nauman, who established a basis from which art can extend into the realm of pure idea while, at the same time, remaining experiential.

Our downing of tools seems linked to a change in our relationship with the material world, provoking a more passive attitude towards the things with which we surround ourselves. When they break we throw them away, unable to fix them and unable (or unwilling) to understand how they work. In recent years, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in making, in notions of self-sufficiency and craftsmanship. While such notions may find particular resonance in these times of economic crisis, they are also part of a larger school of thinking that is reconsidering our relationship to work and production.The exhibition Manufacture 2 explores what ���production�۝ means for artists today, not only in relation to art history but also to the shifts in our globalized, consumer society. Descendants of conceptual art as much as of our industrial heritage, the artists in Manufacture do not hesitate to delve into craftsmanship, the recuperation of materials, bricolage, employing a vocabulary of forms, gestures and techniques while avoiding the fetishisation of perfect technique. In fact, several share the practice of consciously ���misusing�۝ their chosen materials and techniques. Others explore the possibilities offered by the unknown, by failure, chance and accident.What inspires them all in their production processes ��� sometimes spontaneous, sometimes laborious ��� is the question of practice and how this practice entails a form of emancipation. In this back-and-forth between artisanal and industrial processes, between contemporary and traditional materials, between thought and form, the artists of the exhibition develop a shared approach based on experimentation and empiricism.Manufacture 2 is curated Zo�� Gray and follows the exhibition Manufacture, previously shown at Parc Saint L̩ger, Centre d'art contemporain, France during Summer 2011.",447; 448; 449; 450; 451; 452; 453; 454; 455; 456; 1922; 1923

The exhibition is part of the 2011 national tour of ARTIST ROOMS, a new collection of modern and contemporary art held by Tate and National Galleries of Scotland for the nation, in partnership with the Art Fund. At John Hansard Gallery you can see Warhol�۪s hugely influential film and photography, while at Southampton City Art Gallery an iconic range of paintings, prints and posters are on show, alongside an Andy Warhol ���Factory Room�۪ activity space for young people and families. John Hansard Gallery: Film and PhotographyAt the John Hansard Gallery visitors can explore rarely-seen stitched photographs and self-portraits from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, alongside iconic film works from the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. Capturing images and moments on film was at the heart of Andy Warhol�۪s approach to art ��� whether a celebrity portrait, a banal, everyday scene or people visiting the Factory, his infamous New York studio hangout. Many of these images became source material for now famous paintings and prints, and some remained as important works in their own right. Warhol was a highly experimental filmmaker. One of the most famous series of works are the Screen Tests ��� short, filmed portraits of Warhol�۪s friends, colleagues and Factory visitors. Screen Tests by Dennis Hopper, Marcel Duchamp, Susan Sontag and Factory regulars Edie Sedgwick, Billy Name and Ann Buchanan are on show here. Sedgwick was the brightest of the Factory stars and she also stars here in Lupe (1965), a two screen film based on the short, tragic life of actress Lupe V̩lez. In 1970, Warhol began recording life around him using portable video equipment. The resulting Factory Diaries, made between 1970 and1982, reveal the inner workings of Warhol�۪s world and could be seen as a precursor of today�۪s Reality TV.��Warhol�۪s focus shifted to photography in the late 1970s. He not only captured people but also scenes and objects around New York that he found curious or extraordinary. Some of these images were transformed into Stitched Photographs (1986), in which repeated prints are literally sewn together. Warhol was preoccupied with self-image and found his own appearance problematic. He produced countless self-portraits, often using a Polaroid camera. This provided an instant method by which to experiment with poses, outfits and wigs, and were often the basis for other works. To complement these, there are four photographs of Warhol by Robert Mapplethorpe on show from the ARTIST ROOMS collection. Warhol and Mapplethorpe were both key figures in New York�۪s avant-garde scene of the 1970s and 80s. The lasting legacy of Warhol�۪s film and photography is still being felt today, leaving its mark both within television and the work of countless contemporary artists and film-makers.",457; 458; 459; 460; 1693; 1694; 1695; 1696; 1697; 1698; 1699; 1700; 1701; 1702; 1703; 1704; 1705; 1706; 1707; 1708; 1709; 1710; 1711; 1712; 1713; 1714; 1715; 1716; 1717; 1718; 1719; 1720; 1721; 1722; 1723; 1724; 1725; 1726; 1727; 1728; 1729

They are not intended to represent anything other than what they are.�۝ Charlotte Posenenske, 1968.Charlotte Posenenske (1930���1985) is one of the key German artists of the 1960s, whose work heralded, along with artists such as Donald Judd, the development of minimalism. This exhibition has been made especially for the John Hansard Gallery and includes the steel constructions ��� resembling industrially manufactured ventilation ducts ��� for which she is perhaps best known, alongside Revolving Vanes, paintings, drawings and wall reliefs.Charlotte Posenenske worked as a theatre stage designer before her artistic career began in the early 1950s. She increasingly turned to industrial materials, creating objects that could be repeated and reconfigured ad inifinitum, and sold her work only at its production value, resisting the conventions of the art market. Despite considerable critical success, the artist felt that she could take this trajectory no further and, in 1968, stopped making art altogether to work as a sociologist.Since her death in 1985, recognition of Posenenske�۪s work has been brought to a wider public through major solo exhibitions, including Frankfurt Museum of Modern Art (1990), Taxispalais, Innsbruck (2005), Documenta II, Kassel (2007), Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2010), Haus Konstruktiv, Z�_rich(2010) and Artists Space New York 2010).Charlotte Posenenske is a John Hansard Gallery exhibition conceived in collaboration with the executor of the artist�۪s estate, Dr. Burkhard Brunn.

Into this shifting, elemental landscape, Maclennan introduces two iconic characters: an archaeologist and a prospector; each of them methodically journeying across this apparently empty but symbolically charged terrain.For both protagonists, the lie of the land merely prefigures a deeper preoccupation with what lies beneath ��� an excavation of the forgotten legacies and uncertain narratives of history, as well as an increasingly frenetic material probing (gathering pace throughout this part of Central Asia) for pockets of mineral wealth. These parallel journeys, evoking the magnetic attraction of the frontier, as an untamed tabula rasa and as the site of a half remembered Eden, are implicitly inflected by the imported iconography of the American West, as if these remote, uncharted vistas offered new scope for these enduring myths to be enacted. Overlaying rival trajectories and competing incentives, Maclennan's overlapping, often contradictory stories echo the fundamental indeterminacy of the desert landscape itself: unreliable, unpredictable, even treacherous, yet still a beguiling, open-ended canvas for human hopes and dreams.Alongside the 30-minute video projection, Maclennan shows a number of wall-based works. Soviet-era posters and anonymous historical photo-documents are supplemented by fragments of archive film, and accompanied by Maclennan�۪s own location stills, taken at the time of the shoot of Anarcadia, or during earlier trips to Kazakhstan.

Founded in 1937 by Tom Harrisson, Charles Madge and Humphrey Jennings, MO used a team of trained observers and volunteer writers to gather information concerning everyday life in Britain. Though considered progressive in giving a voice to ordinary people, for some, MO was perceived as an intrusion based on concealed methods of recording social behaviour.Brennan�۪s encounter with the MO archive combines an artist�۪s book, vinyl drawings, original archival material and the re-working of a fascinating account by British explorer and archaeologist T.C.

Taking descriptions and drawings made by Lethbridge as a starting point, Brennan represents this data in the form of large, colourful maps inspired by the Isotype graphical system developed in the 1930s.English Anxieties�۪ second theme revolves around the work of the Ashington Miners, whose exhibition Unprofessional Painting was shown in London during the 1940s.

The group made its presence felt through public demonstrations, rallies, industrial sabotage and extensive media coverage, and was aligned with national separatist movements such as Sinn Fein and Free Basque. Hidden Country draws on the contents of the court files for the Crown Prosecution case against members of the FWA in 1969, which concluded on the eve of the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. The material ranges from police photography to scenes of FWA manoeuvres staged for journalists and film-makers. The exhibition features new prints digitally scanned from the originals, now badly deteriorated, and held at the National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth. Hidden Country reflects on the status of images as document or fiction in the service of State surveillance and propaganda.

In this, her most ambitious work to date, the artist returns to the place in which she grew up - the remote community and former radar base of Balnakiel, on the North West Coast of Scotland.The film work at the centre of the exhibition offers a vivid portrait of this remarkable location, situated at the furthermost edge of Britain. Here, the extremes and vicissitudes of weather are echoed by the intermittent thunder of RAF and Royal Navy manoeuvres, as the area remains an active bombing range. Balnakiel reveals this brooding, melancholy landscape and the lives of successive residents, both of Balnakiel and the nearby, older clearance village of Durness, which has its own violent legacy dating from the time of the Highland Clearances.The personal journeys of a young girl and the voices and recollections of other local inhabitants build a captivating picture of this community situated at the forefront of social and cultural change.The work considers the complex interaction between individual and collective memory, informed by a series of exchanges with cognitive psychologist Martin A. Conway. Through these conversations, the artist has produced a range of scientific drawings that, alongside the film, attempt to map a new understanding of the experience and behaviour of human memory in the face of trauma.The exhibition also features a powerful collection of photographic portraits of the Balnakiel community, taken by Illingworth. Celebrating the resilience of these isolated settlements, while noting the slow and progressive history of depopulation that haunts this landscape, Balnakiel gives voice to contrasting perceptions and constructions of the past.Shona Illingworth has exhibited extensively in Europe, Canada and the UK and has received a number of high profile awards, including commissions for Channel 4, the Hayward Gallery and the Wellcome Trust.

Shown together for the first time, they reveal lines of continuity that have persisted over four decades, representing Ward�۪s study of the world ��� that is, of light, the body, the activity of line and the sensitive nature of surfaces.Early collaged photograms combine ordered, repetitive motifs with delicate, unpredictable lines of exposed light. An hypnotic film projection of an Amazonian river surface transcends its subject matter to become abstract, almost immaterial. Multiple line drawings convey the stasis and motion of figures in a live performance.

Presiding over the story is Nobodaddy, a mischievous, unforgiving creator, named after William Blake�۪s term for God within the Old Testament.Bolotin�۪s world is meticulously and vividly realised, an evocative hybrid of German expressionism, Brueghel and medieval religious imagery.

They playfully exist somewhere between abstraction and the recognisable world and they hint both at humour and tragedy.Geometry Wars presents a new body of work, comprising twenty one paintings and two sculptures. Painted mostly in 'greyscale' and muted tones, Bolivar's palette presents a flipside to the witticism often associated with his paintings, reminding us, in the words of Peter Ustinov, that comedy is simply a funny way of being serious.The phrase Geometry Wars describes Bolivar's 'struggle with abstraction' - whether to subjugate 'the square', and present it as pure form or whether to animate it into the world of figuration.Paintings such as Silver, 2007, exemplify Bolivar's approach. The work could resemble a reflective surface such as the window in a lighthouse; a painting of a photograph (Silver as in silver nitrate) or even a painting of a painting. It is also a geometric arrangement; and it is suggestive of the work of other abstract artists such as Elsworth Kelly or Kasimir Malevich.The exhibition title alludes at a political resonance reflected in a number of works featuring familiar war imagery - a battleship, a plane, a watchtower and a bunker. But Bolivar also point to his concerns for pure abstraction and formalism by the inclusion of two sculptures in this exhibition. Prototype Meter - a small gold bar and Prototype Kilogram - a black (25 Kg.) weight. Here the question remains - are these props simply reminders of our systems for weight and measures, or are we to read further meanings and associations suggested by these?Bolivar's paintings hover between the ridiculous and the sublime. They allude at other worlds beyond the picture plane such as in paintings like Bell. However under closer inspection, paintings such as Raft of the Medusa or Shack, show a battered side to modernism's promise of a new world.Juan Bolivar was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1966 and lives and works in London. He was selected for EAST International 2007, Norwich and has exhibited in numerous group exhibitions in the UK and internationally.

2008_4_OGS_CRAWFORD,2008,22/04/2008,14/06/2008,O.G.S. Crawford,Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford,653,"Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford (1886 ��� 1957) was a field archaeologist who pioneered aerial photography after seeing its potential in the First World War. He was the first Archaeology Officer at the Ordnance Survey in Southampton, and lived for most of his life in Nursling, just outside the city, where he is buried. He was an influential and visionary figure in the history of archaeology in this country. This exhibition, ranging from images of archaeological sites, anti-Nazi graffiti in Berlin between the wars and advertising hoardings, to images of suburban developments in his home city, is based on Crawford�۪s extraordinary archive of photographs, mostly taken by himself and never before shown.Distance, in Crawford�۪s view, brought clarity; and he saw world history ��� and the future ��� in the broadest possible perspective, perceiving patterns in times past and in things to come. The passage of time, from prehistory to a utopian future, could be charted (and photographed); it was evident in the design of ploughs, for instance, in the rise and fall of superstitions, in the organization of domestic space.Since the 1960s the process of collecting, categorising and archiving images and objects has underpinned the approach of many artists, to which Crawford�۪s photographic practice bears a striking relationship. Crawford was himself an expert photographer, emerging at the same time as well-known modernist photographers like Walker Evans, the German New Objectivity photographers, and in this country, Neo-Romantic artists like Paul Nash and John Piper.Yet in Crawford�۪s opinion there was no time for art, when there was so much to be discovered by science; and when evolution was speeding up towards the bright socialist future he perceived in Soviet Russia. His political faith did not last and the preparations he took for a Brave New World turned out to be redundant. But this diverse and affecting archive remains the evidence of his vision.O.G.S.

Touching Black Ice is a sound installation exploring the legacy of the Titanic. Centred around a full-size sailing boat, emotive soundscapes interweave with interpretations of oral testimony from Titanic survivors. The boat forms a symbolic centre-piece, a vessel charged with catastrophic significance. (The boat is a beautiful hand-made 'Wagtail' dinghy loaned by Hampshire-based Salterns Boatbuilders - see below for more details.Elsewhere a new film, Estonia, retraces the circumstances surrounding the more recent Baltic disaster. Revisiting the embarkation points and sea routes of the MV Estonia, Brisley combines filmed footage with his own spoken narrative describing the event. The film is interspersed with diagrammatic imagery of the ferry�۪s final movements, combined with chilling radio exchanges between the sinking Estonia and approaching ships.The exhibition examines how these disasters reflect the anxieties of the age in which they occurred. The Titanic, with the loss of 1523 lives after leaving the port of Southampton on its maiden voyage in 1912, shattered the belief that the machine age would conquer nature. And in 1994 the sinking of the MV Estonia Ferry in the Baltic Sea, with 852 lives lost, has been surrounded by conspiracy theories of military involvement.The exhibition provides a compelling account of two events that shook the world at the beginning and end of the 20th century.The exhibition will be accompanied by a new publication with essays by Stuart Brisley, Stephen Foster, Director, John Hansard Gallery, Andrew Wilson, Curator of Modern and Contemporary British Art, Tate, and Anders H�_rm, Curator, Tallinna Kunstihoone, Estonia.Stuart Brisley: Crossings is a John Hansard Gallery exhibition supported by The Henry Moore Foundation and the Oral History Unit, Southampton City Council.

Today, however, working ports are increasingly separated off from everyday life, becoming sealed points of exchange on a worldwide network of trade, and sensitive entry points for the migrant worker.Several works in the exhibition draw attention to the experience of migration, in particular between North Africa and so-called ���Fortress Europe�۪. Ursula Biemann�۪s video installation Sahara Chronicle follows the route of migrants across the desert to their embarkation points, filmed over three years in Niger, Mauritania and Morocco. Yto Barrada�۪s work refers to the Straits of Gibraltar, the narrow divide between Europe and Africa. Her photographic series Sleepers presents images from her home town of Tangiers, where would-be ̩migr̩s await their moment of passage.Elsewhere, Melanie Jackson�۪s The Undesirables re-creates the scene of the stricken cargo ship MSC Napoli, beached off of Devon�۪s Jurassic coastline earlier this year, using intricate paper models. Meschac Gaba�۪s Sweetness is a model city, comprising buildings from across the world made from sugar. Two new landmark buildings from Southampton, chosen by local people, have been added to the work. In the Gallery Reading Room, visitors can explore Mary Evans�۪ Blighty, Guinea, Dixie, 2007, featuring kaleidoscopes revealing contemporary scenes from historic trans-atlantic trade routes.As part of Port City the Maghreb Connection Screening Programme will be shown in the Project Room.

These events (often experienced live by only a small audience) are primarily received through still images: arguably subjective records, translated through the ideas and aesthetics of the photographer.The exhibition contextualises performance photography within the photographers�۪ wider practices. Many are well known in very different contexts (from reportage to cinematography and architectural photography) as well as being acknowledged as artists in their own right.Works featured include Japanese photographer Ohtsuji Kiyoji�۪s photographs of the 1950s Gutai group, shown alongside his surrealist photography, and writings. Peter Moore�۪s architectural photographs of Penn Station, documenting the station�۪s gradual destruction from 1962 to 1966, are seen in relation to examples from his extensive archive of USA performance photographs, including Allan Kaprow�۪s and Wolf Vostell�۪s Happenings. The relationship between the ���photographed�۪, the camera and the viewer was addressed in early works by Babette Mangolte, such as her film 'Le Camera: Je 1977' and 'A Photo Installation, 1978'. In a parallel practice Mangolte also extensively photographed performance works by Yvonne Rainer, Robert Whitman, Joan Jonas, Richard Foreman and Trisha Brown.In the case of Carolee Schneemann�۪s work many different photographers documented single performances. The exhibition reveals the diverse photographic styles of these individuals, compared and contextualised in relation to their ongoing practices.Ana Mendieta�۪s performances were recorded by a number of friends, fellow students and family members. Mendieta�۪s lover and tutor, artist Hans Breder, made the photo-documentation of some of her early performances in Iowa and Oaxaca. In the same locations and often within the same time-frame, Hans Breder also photographed his own site-specific works, for which Mendieta sometimes modelled.Artists and photographers in Live Art on Camera: Marina Abramovic and Ulay, Dona Ann McAdams, Hans Breder, Stuart Brisley and Leslie Haslam, Hollis Frampton, Hugo Glendinning, Gutai Group, Lisa Kahane, Ute Klophaus, Jennifer Kotter, Kurt Kren, Antonio Lauer, Babette Mangolte, Rosemary Mayer, Fred W.

The relationship between Britain, its constituent elements and its people dominates both the media and party politics.North + South is an unprecedented collaborative project that explores who we think we are and what, in the twenty-first century, England stands for. Staged across six unique exhibitions, in galleries at the northern and southernmost ends of England, North + South features over thirty artists, including fifteen newly commissioned works.John Hansard Gallery visitors can explore six artists�۪ work. Newly commissioned artists include Jennifer Anyan, who examines the eccentricities of English regional fashion through multi-layered photographic works, museological displays of objects and clothing, and informal observational images and text. Is the English dress-sense inherently eccentric, or do conformities and localised styles exist?��7 Nights, 7 Bed & Breakfasts, 7 Full English breakfasts by Jane Chavez-Dawson is a playful film work examining ���quintessential�۪ English B & Bs. Located in towns and villages that assert their own English 'authenticity' in different ways, the work asks whether the idea of Englishness is imposd upon or can genuinely be part of an English town.Track and Place is a mail art project co-ordinated by Matt Hearn and Sarah Warden, comprising a rich archive of accumulated artists�۪ correspondence from either side of the perceived ���north/south�۪ divide. An initial letter was distributed, inviting artists to participate in a process of forwarding letters and their own, unspecificied, artistic contributions, back and forth between North and South - akin to a game of 'postal ping-pong'.Other works include Samar Asamoah�۪s Greenhouse, 2006, a normal garden greenhouse intricately etched with Islamic symbols and patterning. The work contrasts the desire to cultivate one�۪s own piece of England ��� a ���miniature Eden�۪ ��� with the geometry of the heavenly realm.Susan Diab�۪s Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!, 2006, shown in all six venues, features the traditional English seaside song of the title, sung in Arabic by the artist. For Diab, whose parents are English and Syrian, the work reminds us that identity is rarely monolithic or related to appearance alone.John Kippin�۪s large-scale photographic works, Nationality, Identity and Mythology, 2005, place together images of English landscapes with overlying words, examining how nationalism is frequently linked to ownership or ���rights�۪ over land and territory.To accompany North + South, a selection of rarely-seen films by Wilf Thust and William Raban, exploring English multi-cultural identity from the 1980�۪s to the present day,��are shown in the Gallery Project Room.

Digital video technology lies at the heart of this extensive creative scene, whose ascent into the global arena reflects a wider Western upsurge of interest in all things China.The work of thirteen artists will feature across the gallery in a network of projections and monitor screens. Works include 8gg�۪s News Dance, 2005, a visceral re-mix of CCTV and news footage, Li Songhua�۪s Keynote Speech, 2005, in which his four year-old child re-enacts a political speech by Chinese President Hu Jintao, Meng Jin�۪s explorations of abandoned industrial spaces and much more.The flexibility of the medium has enabled these artists to achieve a multitude of results, from ambitious studio productions to low-budget hand-held camera work, free from the perceived constraints of more traditional art forms.The majority of artists in Chinese Video Now live and work in major urban centres like Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, experiencing first-hand the growing consumer culture and rapid urban development of contemporary China.

Drawing together newly commissioned work made around the south coast of England and internationally, Fig. traces links between photography, imperialism and the colonial impulse to acquire, map and collect.The exhibition�۪s diverse imagery harks back to an era of Victorian collecting, which resulted in strange accumulations of objects being deposited in local museums throughout the UK. Here, with pictures framed in acrylic boxes that suggest the scientific preservation and display of museum objects, the exhibition has become the photographers�۪ own questioning take on the ���cabinet of curiosities�۪. As Broomberg and Chanarin have observed:���the history of photography is intimately bound up with the idea of colonial power. Documentary photographers today have a worrying amount in common with the collector/adventurers of past eras. As unreliable witnesses, we have gathered together ���evidence�۪ of our experiences and present our findings in this exhibition; a muddle of fact and fantasy.�۪The free booklet available in the gallery, to be read in connection with the photographs, provides titles and texts that draw together this disparate selection of work into the artists�۪ own interconnecting narrative. Figure numbers beneath each image should be cross-referenced with the corresponding numbers in the booklet.Oliver Chanarin and Adam Broomberg have been photographing together for more than nine years. Their work has been exhibited internationally and they are the recipients of numerous awards including a Royal Photographic Society award in 2005.

Their remarkable stories are told across forty separate films, shown on old televisions dispersed throughout Court 1 of Southampton�۪s magnificent former Magistrates�۪ Courts. Taking a seat in front of one film to the next, you can meet each resident face to face - from Guler the wife hiding terrible secrets, to Soner the film buff who loves 'Notting Hill' or Erol the loner, fascinated by birds but caught in a spiral of violence. Set against the gravitas of the court room, these tales of pain, suffering, humour and compassion gain even greater significance.Turner Prize-nominated artist and film-maker Kutlug Ataman spent a year exploring K��BA, an area of makeshift hut dwellings made of cheap materials, scrap metal and soil, squeezed in the midst of Istanbul�۪s low-income suburban blocks. K��BA is home to non-conformists of diverse ethnicity, religion and political persuasion, united in their defiant resistance of state control. Despite the extreme poverty of their surroundings, the residents of K��BA are bound by a web of community values that embrace personal freedom and mutual tolerance. A thief from K��BA will never steal from his neighbours nor will a murderer harm them. Children are precious and valued, food is common property and a family will not be allowed to go without.Through the stories of each resident, visitors can build a picture of K��BA both as a place, and a state of mind. For living in K��BA ��� above all else ��� defines each inhabitant�۪s sense of identity, regardless of background or belief. If you�۪re from K��BA, then that is enough.K��BA first appeared in Pittsburgh in 2004, winning the prestigious Carnegie Prize. Having since travelled to Germany, Australia, Austria, Belgium and within the UK, its global journey concludes in Southampton. K��BA is the first exhibition to take place in Southampton�۪s former Magistrates�۪ Courts, which have remained mostly closed to the public since the 1990s. The Courts are part of the Grade II Listed Civic Centre, built between 1930 and 1936. All original court furniture is utilised within the exhibition.K��BA was commissioned and produced by Artangel.

A collective of six artists focusing on performance and time-based work, the group later evolved into Projects UK (1984 to 1992), the UK�۪s first office-based organisation, working with artists to develop site-specific events and temporary works.This role was expanded by Locus+ (1993-), who have since commissioned and published a wide spectrum of innovative, socially engaged, collaborative visual arts projects, across the country and beyond.This Will Not Happen Without You will enable visitors to explore documentation of performances, projects and events, along with objects, ephemera, publications and artist�۪s proposals, spanning the history of the three organisations.The exhibition documents unique performances by artists including Stuart Brisley, Mona Hatoum, Bruce McLean, Silvia Ziranek, Alastair MacLennan, Rose English, Nan Hoover and Charlie Hooker.Projects featured include a series of commissions by Stefan Gec which deal with his background as a second generation Ukranian. Natural History comprised six large black and white photographic portraits, installed in outdoor locations in Newcastle upon Tyne and Canada, of the first six firemen killed in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986.Repens, a temporary commission for Compton Verney by Anya Gallaccio, transformed an internal ceiling feature (designed by Robert Adam for Lord Willoughby de Broke in 1763) into a landscape design, imposed onto the lawns of the estate.

Can we still find meaning in the obsolete or low-tech? Slow Life unites seven international artists who explore the humanity within out-dated technologies and old materials.Wilfrid Almendra, based in France, exhibits two hand-crafted replicas of mass-produced hardware tools ��� a pickaxe and trowel. These objects undermine the convenience of machine production, instead highlighting the meditative effect of time-consuming, elaborate labour.South African-born, London-based Dale Berning has sampled old ���78�۪ records, played through a gramophone in a bathroom. These intimate soundtracks are transferred to dubplate, a brittle alternative to vinyl that degrades through use. Visitors can play these in the gallery, compounding a process of decay denied in digital media.Canadian artist Mark Karasick paints from digital video, taken here from an internet forum where members showcase their portraits during the point of orgasm. Karasick manipulates these images using encaustic, an archaic wax-painting technique. Building countless translucent layers, this process distorts and prolongs an otherwise fleeting moment.Tokyo-based Ryota Kuwakubo explores the boundaries between digital and analogue technology. Here the artist has created a series of handmade radios, programmed to extract only consonant sounds from the broadcast. With all meaning and information removed, the sound of breath results: a human essence.Slow Life also features three animation films by Tomoyasu Murata. A long-term resident of Tokyo�۪s old town, Murata�۪s work explores the survival of values despite changes in urban society. Using handmade puppets and props, these works depict the human emotion and pathos in everyday life.Columbian-born Beltran Obregon revisits his childhood pastime of tinfoil rockets. Propelled by a match, the launch of these flimsy spacecraft is captured in a series of photographs. By turns comical, calamitous and triumphant, these images embody a universal ambition to conquer space through technology, and its pitfalls.Wolfgang Staehle, based in New York, is recognised as one of the pioneers of internet art. Eastpoint, 2004 is a continuous projection of 10,000 digital images of the Hudson Valley, taken at regular intervals. Revisiting the subject of 19th century Hudson River painters, Staehle presents a landscape removed of inflection and artifice. Infinitesimal changes occur over hours of footage, at odds with the speed and urgency of contemporary life.Slow Life is curated by Yuu Takehisa.

British artist John Latham (1921 ��� 2006), applied this to the biggest subjects of all: what is the Universe? What is God? What is knowledge? Latham aspired that art could form a point of convergence for opposing beliefs within society.This exhibition, conceived with the artist prior to his death in January 2006, allows visitors to explore major stages within his fifty-year career.Works featured include a selection of Clusters, each one a compacted, globe-like mass of plaster, book fragments and wire. Suspended from the ceiling, these celestial objects evoke the aftermath of colliding forces. A range of Book Reliefs and Sculptures, including Soft Skoob, 1964, reveal the artist�۪s use of the spray gun, combined with the inclusion of books, whether burnt, torn, or stacked. Symbolising the bodies of knowledge that emerge from, yet divide society, they appear throughout much of Latham�۪s work.Glass was another material favoured by the artist; tangible yet transparent, it embodied Latham�۪s theory of a ���non-extended state�۪, or time at its smallest unit. Latham often combined books and glass to suggest how different belief systems can stem from a single source of enlightenment.Latham�۪s theories bridged art, science and theology, and aimed to present a single, unifying explanation of existence. Based upon the idea of ���Event Structure�۪, he proposed that time, expressed as a series of ���least events�۪, could describe the structure of the world.Time Base Roller, 1972 forms a centre-piece to the exhibition, and directly illustrates these ideas. Comprising a rotating cylinder, a striped canvas strip unrolls via motor to demonstrate the continuing passage of time. Inscriptions on the back of the roller represent the memory of the past, akin to a musical score.Both acclaimed and vilified in his lifetime, Latham is one of the few genuine radicals of post-war British art. A selection of the artist�۪s films, spanning his career, will be shown in the Project Room.John Latham: Time Base and the Universe is a collaboration between John Hansard Gallery and P.S.1.

More ���poetic description�۪ than documentary, these works reflect upon shifts in the global geopolitical order, often drawing upon the artist�۪s own personal experience of migration.The exhibition features two new works - Point of Departure and Adrift. Point of Departure was filmed in both Stansted Airport and Trabzon Airport, Turkey, and contrasts the experience of transit and travel through the perspectives of two characters. The work focuses on what ��avusoglu calls ���the end points of the European idea�۝ by contrasting two airports on the fringes of the Atlantic and the former Soviet bloc. Weaving together footage from both, he allows us to look again at the apparently ���everyday�۪ act of crossing frontier points: these ���non-places�۪ become strange, beautiful and unsettling.Adrift provides a counter-point to Point of Departure�۪s linear storyline. Intertwining footage shot across Europe and the United States, projected images cut between cities and seascapes, where disparate characters drift into apparently endless journeys. Intense and rhythmical, the work probes the history of migration, forced or otherwise.A third work, Dissonant Rhythms I, 2004, features in the Gallery Project Room. Two monitors contrast film footage of ���Fort van Ertbrand�۪, a military headquarters on the outskirts of Antwerp, completed before the outbreak of World War I, with that of bunkers, parts of a tank trap, built during World War II in the same area. The sound of footsteps forms an unsettling soundtrack to the work, which evokes the haunting emotional and physical presence these war remnants still retain.Ergin ��avusoglu�۪s recent exhibitions include a one-person exhibition at Dundee Contemporary Arts; representing Turkey at the Venice Biennale 2003; the 8th Istanbul Biennial; 3rd Berlin Biennale; inclusion in Becks Futures 2004 and the British Art Show 6.Point of Departure is co-commissioned by Film and Video Umbrella and Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art.

With a drawing, a doodle, a chance event, a colour? And how does this define the appearance of the final work? This exhibition explores the process of ���cause and effect�۪ within the work of three painters, spanning three generations of art.British painter and critic Patrick Heron (1920 ��� 1999) is arguably Britain�۪s greatest abstract artist, sustaining an international reputation throughout his lifetime and beyond. Three works from the 1970s will be on show, each featuring dazzling areas of colour, juxtaposed across the canvas in a series of jigsaw-like shapes. These shapes are formed at the beginning of the work through rapid freehand drawing. Expanses of solid colour are then created with thousands of small brush strokes, using a Chinese calligraphy brush. The resulting surface is both uniform and intricate, contrasting spontaneity with a labour-intensive technique.Produced almost twenty years later are three works by New York-based painter Jonathan Lasker (b.1948). Rising to international prominence in 1980s, the artist has exhibited at events such as Documenta IX and the Venice Biennale. Lasker initially creates small doodles, which he then reproduces, vastly magnified, within large paintings. The results are a flat, almost cartoon-like array of dots, lines and squiggles. These are jarringly overlaid by smaller areas of thick, more disorderly paint. The controlled, methodical finish of the works contrast dramatically with the frenetic, subconscious activity of doodling or scribbling, from which they began.Created a further two decades on are three works by Katie Pratt (b.1969), who, in 2001, was the youngest ever winner of the Jerwood Painting Prize, Britain�۪s most prestigious painting award. Her canvases are scattered with seemingly arbitrary marks and globules, around which circulate a network of dots, lines and accretions. Pratt begins abruptly, throwing paint randomly onto the canvas. With this initial structure established, the artist then creates rules and systems to ���complete�۪ the work, to which she adheres almost mechanically. In this way, the paintings develop their own ���fuzzy logic�۪, with their appearance virtually ungoverned by the artist.This exhibition has been organised by the John Hansard Gallery.

But what if, searching closer to home, we unearthed the decaying crypt of a man, preserved for eternity in his own flat? In the murky depths of the gallery, artists Shaun Doyle and Mally Mallinson have created the tomb of a modern recluse ��� a man they call King Tat.Enter the gallery and a corridor leads you to the antechamber. Gaping holes in the walls afford views into a room, scattered with flimsy household goods. Grimy mattresses loll against peeling flock wallpaper and a small car nestles in a corner, a carriage for the afterlife. Two four-foot high polystyrene dogs guard the burial chamber, which is barred by breeze-blocks.The corridor leads on to reveal the burial chamber itself, dominated by a hulking chest-freezer, the sarcophagus. The chamber is adorned with housing estate murals and gaudy street-racing imagery, visions of a ���live fast�۪ modern culture, a distorted echo of Egyptian tomb decoration. The corridor leads out into the gallery, where the exterior of the construction is visibleJust who is King Tat? A loathsome figure, who has memorialised his own lazy existence? Or an embodiment of loneliness, seeking solace in the afterlife, surrounded by shabby possessions and images of escape?Doyle and Mallinson have created a darkly humorous work exploring Western society�۪s voyeuristic obsession with death and ceremony. Constructed uniquely for the gallery space, it parodies the facsimile of Tutankhamun�۪s tomb created for the ���amusements�۪ section of the 1924 British Empire exhibition. Contrasting the extravagance of ���high�۪ culture, with the mundane and everyday, it asks the crucial question: what creates spiritual value in the modern age?Complementing King Tat will be Waiting, 1974, a film by British artist Elisabeth Kozmian-Ledward, shown in the Project Room.

This exhibition explores the unique environment of university campuses, looking at their recent past and ideas surrounding their future.Canadian artist Nancy Davenport has produced Campus, a series of digitally manipulated photographs, shot at universities in the USA and Canada. Presenting melancholic scenes of ���New Brutalist�۪ architecture, embraced as revolutionary after the 1968 student uprisings, these structures now seem fortress-like. Incorporating unreal lighting effects, the works evoke an uneasy tension between optimism and aftermath.Also shown is Davenport�۪s video piece Weekend Campus, a slow horizontal pan along the entrance to a fictitious campus, jammed with stalled cars, accidents and witnesses. This continuous loop, constructed from hundreds of still photographs, pays homage to Jean-Luc Godard�۪s apocalyptic film ���Le Week-end�۪.Jakob Jakobsen and Henriette Heise from the Copenhagen Free University present Five Theses on Taking Power Without Becoming Government, a large-scale sound installation. A mountain of amplified concert speakers broadcast a spoken statement, almost inaudible amid the hum of feedback, proffering ideas on what it means to create a self-organized University. The speakers embody the huge potential for knowledge and power existing in everyday life. Copenhagen Free University is an artist-run, self-organised institution that works with collective, non-exclusive forms of knowledge.Swiss artist Christian Philipp M�_ller presents a series of silkscreen prints, The Campus as a Work of Art, completed for the University of L�_neburg in Germany.

Can art objects become tools to improve our lives? Panacea: the art of wellbeing is an evolving, expandable and travelling artwork, designed to function as a universal formula to cure social, economic and political problems.At the core of this experiment is the Panacea Model, a maquette of an idealised health paradise, constructed by all three artists and made from medical packaging and refuse. Representing a ���global panacea�۪, the Panacea Model offers both generic and specific solutions to health and lifestyle problems.Numerous other artworks, evolved from this maquette, populate the gallery, extending the curing powers of the Panacea. These include Friendly Frontier, by Zo�� Walker and Neil Bromwich, an 11-metre long, hand-sewn, inflatable mountain range, with emergency slides to bridge international borderlines. The work acts as a buoyancy aid for countries in conflict, an open border for all peoples of the world to slide with ease between nation states.Life Pulse, by Michael Pinsky, is a pole-like sculpture that registers and illuminates visitors�۪ heartbeats, creating ever-changing rhythms and patterns of light.

The exhibition explores the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and his interest in the landscape (of language), and architecture within landscape.The remote places to which Wittgenstein was drawn include the northerly landscapes of Iceland and Norway; the alpine village of Trattenbach, where he worked as a school teacher; and the later refuges that he found in Connemara and County Wicklow in Ireland. These landscapes all share a quality of ���quiet seriousness�۪ that reflects aspects of his philosophy and his own psychology.Wittgenstein�۪s retreat to Skjolden, Norway, lies at the heart of the collaboration between Alec Finlay and Guy Moreton. Presenting a descriptive essay in text and photography, they reflect upon the site of Wittgenstein�۪s house overlooking Lake Eidsvatnet and the surrounding landscape. Here he worked on the manuscripts of the Tractatus and Philosophical Investigations, and its relationship to a more general cultural model of a ���house for thought�۪.The austerity and sense of isolation in Finlay�۪s collage poem and Moreton�۪s photographs can also be found in The Dark Night of the Intellect, a new film by Jeremy Millar. Based upon an essay written and, here, narrated by Tim Robinson, the film explores the landscape of Rosroe on Ireland�۪s western coast, described by Wittgenstein as ���the last pool of darkness at the edge of Europe�۪. Another new work brings together footage from the artist�۪s home with a musical echo from Wittgenstein�۪s childhood. It attempts to establish both a sense of belonging and an understanding of how we might engage with the place of another.Wittgenstein was a radical literary theorist, writing philosophy as if it were poetry. There is a poetic intensity to the works on show that illustrates a form of expression more eloquent than language, echoing Wittgenstein�۪s own exploration of the visual depths of language.Yet while this exhibition possesses a quiet, haunting beauty, it is not without a sense of play, perhaps most clearly found within Finlay�۪s Language Games (Word Puzzles) and Wall Wordrawings - wanderings within Wittgenstein�۪s thought, and points from which our own thoughts might also wander.There Where You Are Not has been organised by the John Hansard Gallery.

All share the common quality of being beautifully hand crafted and despite their pristine, almost clinical, appearance are very much products of a painstaking hand made process.

Joan Jonas is a key figure in performance, installation and video art and has maintained her position as a pioneer in these genres since the 1960s - her influence crucial to the development of important aspects of contemporary art.Joan Jonas uses interlocking strands of choreographed movements, video and narrative in an exploration of technology, fragmentation of physical space and female identity. Often the performer, Jonas examines the self and the body through layers of meaning, using recurring themes in an idiosyncratic vocabulary of ritualized gesture and symbolic objects that include masks, mirrors, and costuming.This exhibition of recent works will include two installation based pieces, Lines in the Sand and The Shape, the Scent, the Feel of Things. Based on the poem ���Helen in Egypt�۪ written by H.D. in 1955, Lines in the Sand blurs the boundaries between fact and fiction, presented in a contemporary reworking of the myth.

These exquisite large-scale photographs explore imaginatively the notion of spatial estrangement, considering the formation of the urban landscape and its effect on us materially and psychologically.For urban designers and engineers, modern lighting technologies offer inventive ways to invest the urban landscape with new cultural meanings, through the highlighting and suppression of physical spaces. By editing and colouring, for instance, they can create a setting that is hyper-real and illusory.Shanahan�۪s photographs use a combination of the effect of such ambient artificial lighting, together with the ���reciprocity failure�۪ of colour photographic film (the colour shifts that occur in exposures exceeding one second). Taken in Spain and Portugal between 1998 and 2001, these extraordinary scenes seem familiar and welcoming, yet peculiarly otherworldly and supernatural.Patrick Shanahan is an artist photographer and visiting lecturer and Esperantis is an Open Eye Gallery Touring exhibition.

This is her first solo exhibition in the UK, and surveys the artist�۪s work over the last fifteen years.Sarindar Dhaliwal was born in Punjab and educated in England. She draws on her complex cultural background to make sense of her personal here and now. The work reflects this through Dhaliwal�۪s use of abstract and material symbols (such as turbans, coal, ash, spices and stones). The work combines storytelling, painting and textile installations with print, media and video, resulting in a vibrant, lush and exotic exhibition that is both visually compelling and poetically evocative.Record Keeping was curated and organised by OVA�� in collaboration with the John Hansard Gallery and Agnes Etherington Art Centre, Ontario.

2003_5_PICTURES_FROM,2003,27/05/2003,26/07/2003,Sunil Gupta: Pictures from Here,Sunil Gupta,523,"This summer, the John Hansard Gallery unveils new works by London based artist, Sunil Gupta. The culmination of a three year AHRB Creative and Performing Arts Research Fellowship conducted at the University of Southampton, Pictures From Here (named after the artist's new Autograph book published by Chris Boot) is a solo exhibition showcasing Gupta�۪s latest issue based work about HIV and place.The work featured in this exhibition makes a personal exploration of ���homeland�۪ as experienced by the artist who has lived in London, Northern India and the Eastern part of Canada. The photo-text, photo-document and photo-juxtaposition-cum-montage pieces ��� specially made for this exhibition during a residency at Light Work, Syracuse University ��� act as an individual, cultural geography. They narrate Gupta�۪s personal journey ��� from his birthplace in India, through his adopted homes in Canada and England ��� and his multifarious identity as a gay man of colour with HIV. They further convey the photographic struggle to visualise the complex relationships and identities that belie the Eastern landscape Gupta has inherited and the Western landscape he inhabits. His journey between them and their juxtaposition in the photographic diptych, not only depicts the artist�۪s dislocated relationship to ���homeland�۪ but also the spreading of the HIV virus. Developing this theme, the new video work (A World Without) Pity, 2002, documents the stories of HIV positive people and the professionals managing their treatment. Made during the artist�۪s return to India, the accounts featured reflect Gupta�۪s search for a mirroring of his British HIV experience in India.Trained at the Royal College of Art, Sunil Gupta has worked as a video maker, photographer, curator, writer and academic, and shown throughout North America, India and the UK. His 2001 exhibition, Homelands, toured to London and Admit One Gallery, New York, while works from the solo exhibition From Here to Eternity (2000) were shown at Gallery Sepulchar, Manila and Admit One Gallery, New York. One of his earlier works, Exiles, was recently included in the Tate Britain exhibition Self Evident (October 2002���5 January 2003).Sunil Gupta�۪s work is represented by Sepia International, New York.A John Hansard Gallery exhibition.

In using film, video and photography to enact deeply personal narratives, it shares many of the characteristics of Beban�۪s recent solo exhibition, Still (shown at Site Gallery, Sheffield in 2000). Both exhibit a restless tension between ���Balkan�۪ and ���British�۪ cultural identity. However, whilst Still centred on feelings of loss in relation to death, I Can�۪t Make You Love Me examines contradiction in relation to love.The exhibition revolves around a two-screen projection which combines tracking shots of a dialogue between Beban and her British former lover with haunting images (shot by internationally acclaimed cinematographer Robby M�_ller) of Beban and a Romany band drifting on a raft along the Danube in Belgrade, while performing the walk of the three chairs. The juxtaposition of stills of abandoned beds, views through windows and the sound of a traditional Balkan song Who Doesn�۪t Know How to Suffer Doesn�۪t Know How to Love, function to emphasise the inconsistency and fragility of love.Beban was born and raised in Yugoslavia, and now lives and works between London and Sheffield, where she is a Senior Lecturer at the Northern Media School. In 2001 she was the recipient of a Paul Hamlyn award for the Visual Arts.I Can�۪t Make You Love Me is a Film and Video Umbrella / John Hansard Gallery co-commission supported by the National Touring Programme of the Arts Council of England.",1657; 1658; 1659

By investigating the social and political tensions present in the city, the wide range of works on display both illuminate the uneven spatial and social fabric of Mexico City and situate a gaze upon the multi-layered, and sometimes conflicting, aesthetic of this Third World megalopolis.In emphasising the structures that belie artistic practice, this exhibition also urges us to consider the conditions under which art exists and is produced within the Mexico context. In so doing, 20 Million Mexicans Can�۪t be Wrong stimulates critical reflection upon the risks associated with artistic or cultural exportation and asks us to think about the relationship of culture, art, production and consumption to space. Do the works and all that they represent remain intact despite their displacement to the UK? Or is our appreciation of them constrained by our First World positioning? And what relationships are invoked between practitioner and viewer when much of the work is produced and consumed in such different cultural, political, social and geographical contexts?A great deal of the work on display engages the viewer in a participatory way, and several pieces oblige the gallery visitor to both reinforce the concepts behind the work, and simultaneously produce and consume its aesthetic. Nowhere is this dual process more apparent than in Carlos Amorales�۪ piece, Flames Maquiladora, 2001���2002. Reflecting the numerous manufacturing sweatshops established along the Mexico/U.S. border during the 1990s in order to take advantage of cheap Mexican labour, Amorales�۪ work invites the visitor to take part in the production of wrestlers�۪ trainers ��� products which will later be exhibited and sold as art objects. By involving the visitor in the production process, the artist exploits our labour and turns the gallery into a workshop where First World visitors are compelled to work for the profit of a Third World artist.Organised by South London Gallery and curated by the writer, art historian, critic and curator, Cuauht̩moc Medina, the exhibition is funded by the Arts Council of England�۪s National Touring Programme, The Jumex Collection, the Mexican Ministry for Foreign Affairs and The Felix Trust for Art.",1076; 1077; 1078; 1079; 1080; 1081; 1082
2002_11_WONG_HOY,2002,15/11/2002,20/12/2002,Wong Hoy Cheong,Wong Hoy Cheong,575,"This Autumn, the John Hansard Gallery presents recent works by the most prominent Malaysian artist on the international scene, Wong Hoy Cheong. The exhibition provides a rare opportunity for the British public to give careful consideration to his art practice and to the interrelationships between history, politics, culture and ethnicity that his work explores. Cheong�۪s use of a wide range of materials and media act as a ���visual vocabulary�۪ through which to make visible a number of complex and controversial postcolonial discourses. In so doing, Cheong addresses a number of questions about misrepresentation, authenticity, authoritarianism, social fragmentation, human migration, geographical displacement, diversity, hybridity and the transformation of identity.Born into the newly independent Malaysian nation in 1960, Wong Hoy Cheong completed his higher education in the West before returning to Malaysia to create his artworks. In relocating his art practice to this native context, Cheong challenges the convention that an artist�۪s practice may only mature within a Western centre. The success of his challenge is perhaps best illustrated by the extent to which his work is represented in the national collections of, amongst other nations, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and the United States.The pieces selected for this exhibition have been produced between 1996 and 2002. They reflect the breadth of the artist�۪s interests, the range of materials that he has used, and the way in which his practice has matured ��� from drawings on paper which resonate with memory and family histories, to the installations and sculptural works that Cheong has constructed from a wide range of materials, including, amongst others, the debris of colonisation found in Malaysia and a number of natural materials native to this part of Southeast Asia.Organised by OVA (Organisation of Visual Arts), the exhibition comes to Southampton from Bluecoats Gallery, Liverpool, as part of a three date tour of Britain. The project also comprises a residency at Gasworks, London, established to enable the artist to experience the context of the country in which this exhibition takes place and so that he may make a number of new works whilst positioned on the British side of the post-colonial equation.This exhibition has been curated by Sunil Gupta, and organised and toured by Edward Ward at OVA (The Organisation for Visual Arts).

Michael Snow has been producing seminal works since the 1960s, and he is perhaps best known for Wavelength (1967), which is one of the most influential experimental films ever made. He is an artist who has worked in a wide range of media, including film, photography, sculpture, painting, installation and sound, many of which are represented here.Michael Snow�۪s primary concern is with the ideas surrounding perception and the role of the viewer in relation to a given object or image. The works draw attention to the gaps between an object and its representation. He is very interested in the processes that are involved in the creation of a filmic image, of representation of an image, in terms of time, light, sound, cropping, projection and illusion.The exhibition catalogue Almost Cover to Cover (published by Arnolfini and Black Dog Publishing) including contributions from Michael Snow, Catsou Roberts, Martha Langford, A.L.

Bringing together classic, recent and new film, video, sound and photographic works by Vito Acconci, Sophie Calle, Frances Goodman, Philippine Hoegen, Mako Idemitsu, Mark Lewis, Hayley Newman and Gillian Wearing, the exhibition explores the potential for media-based art to address issues of the personal, the confrontational, the curious and the intrusive.Unprincipled Passions focuses on the development of technology and its increasingly intrusive relationship to the private sphere. Advances in communication, broadcast and surveillance technologies erode time and distance to provide the viewer with an immediate gaze upon worldwide events such as the Gulf War and the collapse of the World Trade Center. Society is increasingly torn between increased surveillance for security and law enforcement, and the apparently incompatible demand for the protection of privacy. At the same time, technology has increasingly enabled the exploration of the private, by, for example, the almost universal use of the hand-held video camera and omnipresent CCTV. Contemporary culture has driven the legitimisation of voyeurism by the growth of victim television programmes like the confessional talk shows hosted by Oprah Winfrey and Jerry Springer and reality television programmes like ���Big Brother�۝, in the interests of entertainment. Unprincipled Passions offers a number of artists who, on the one hand infiltrate this controversial territory and, on the other, offer a critique.Part of the Critical Interventions series of conferences and exhibitions.A major international conference Unprincipled Passions: emotion and modernity is timed to coincide with the exhibition. Following on from two highly successful Critical Interventions events, Evil and Obscene Powers, the Unprincipled Passions conference seeks to examine the complex emotional ���history�۪ of modernity and explores the redefinition of emotional life in response to processes, systems and technologies that have led to the increasing intrusion of non-coercive systems of power into the private, public and cultural spheres.The conference has been organised by the John Hansard Gallery and Ronald Cowdery, and hosted by the University of Southampton and Southampton Institute, 1-3 February 2002.",1211; 1212; 1213; 1214; 1215; 1216; 1217; 1218; 5497
2001_11_GINA_PANE,2001,27/11/2001,19/01/2002,Gina Pane,Gina Pane,175,"This winter, the John Hansard Gallery launches the first UK solo exhibition of the hugely influential French artist, Gina Pane who lived and worked in Paris until her death in 1990. The exhibition is accompanied by the first English language publications about her work, and includes specially commissioned essays by Anne Tronche, Jennifer Blessing and Bernard Blist̬ne.Building on the Gallery�۪s 1999 exhibition Lie of the Land, which showed Pane alongside, amongst others, Ana Mendieta, Dennis Oppenheim, Bill Viola and Marina Abramovic, this project offers timely access to a broader range of work from the artist�۪s archive, French National and Regional Art collections and private lenders. By concentrating upon work from various stages in Pane�۪s career (between 1964-1990), the exhibition examines the relationship between her practice as a painter, sculptor, installation artist and performance artist.Some of the pieces on display, such as Azione Sentimentale (1973), include the photographic documentation of performances in which Pane is seen to enact carefully planned and deliberately controlled self-wounding. In these works, Pane explores the relationship between mark-making on the body and scarring of the landscape, and seeks to demonstrate both the extreme fragility of the body and the reality of suffering. In conjunction with this, the subject matter and symbolic gestures featured in many of her pieces articulate her engagement in late 1960s feminism, identity politics and environmentalism. Whilst such works established Pane�۪s reputation as a seminal artist of feminist practice and performance during the 1960s, 70s and 80s, her legacy for contemporary art practice has become more urgent, making an exhibition of this key historical figure ever more timely.The Gina Pane exhibition is a John Hansard Gallery collaboration with Arnolfini, Bristol where it will be seen (23 February���14 April 2002) in the context of an ambitious contemporary performance art programme. The project has been funded by the Arts Council of England�۪s National Touring Programme and the Henry Moore Foundation.

2001_10_CAREY_YOUNG,2001,02/10/2001,10/11/2001,Carey Young: Business As Usual,Carey Young,67,"In a wide-ranging, multiform practice that encompasses video and photography, as well as a variety of other media, Carey Young considers a number of intriguing parallels between the conceptual principles of contemporary art and the new-model paradigms of 21st-century business. Her survey exhibition, ���Business as Usual�۪, was no routine gallery show. Drawing upon her time spent, first as an employee, and later as artist-in-residence, at several multinational companies, its pieces were versed in the semiotics of the office, and in the neologistic jargon of corporate culture. They also marked out a shift, increasingly prominent as the new media boom of the Nineties merged into the market expansion of the new millennium, in which the ascendancy of brands, and the elevation of services over manufacturing, were underwritten by a new prospectus of entrepreneurial/presentational skills that would become one of the calling-cards of the ���knowledge economy�۪ of the future.This move away from goods that you could hold in your hands to the weightless icons of digital business found an echo, in Young�۪s lateral analysis, in a corresponding trend within the art world towards the dematerialisation of the art object, and a privileging, in conceptual art circles at least, of ideas over artefacts. Channelling a number of canonical conceptual art works as early exemplars of outside-the-box thinking, Young�۪s portfolio of videos, photographs and wall-based texts illuminated the mania for innovation that drives both creative and market activity, and also the rapidity with which genuinely radical thought becomes co-opted and commodified. Nowhere is this more evident than in the video, ���I am a Revolutionary�۪. Part parable, part parody, it records Young�۪s encounter with a professional media-trainer who, in coaching her in the virtues of better communication, coaxes her to modulate the content of her prepared presentation for better effect. An object lesson in the extent to which the medium both defines and elides the message, it captures something of the spirit of a superficially groundbreaking, intrinsically image-conscious, increasingly spin-obsessed time.A Film and Video Umbrella Touring Exhibition curated in association with John Hansard Gallery.",1237; 1238; 1239; 1240

In films of three different solo cello pieces performed by Anton Lukoszevieze, Parker investigates the relationship between music, film structure and the body. One film is a document of Lukoszevieze playing Helmut Oehring's 1993 composition ""Foxfire Bins <natriumpentothal>"". Both Oehring's parents were deaf and the composer only learnt to speak at the age of four. His music is profoundly affected by signing, his first language, and physical gestures are integral to his work. Above all else Jayne Parker's work is about felt experience. Her films give poetic form to intense inner feelings which by their very nature defy representation. Born in 1957, since 1979 Parker has made twenty-one films, as well as numerous installations.A Film and Video Umbrella Touring Exhibition in association with Spacex Gallery, Exeter, John Hansard Gallery and Aldeburgh Festival.",2001; 2002; 2003; 2004; 2005; 2006

Prior to this period many of the cities - Vienna, Prague and Budapest in particular - were international cultural centres, but afterwards were dominated by state controlled socialist realism.

Hansard records everything spoken in parliamentary debates. Over the past four months, the artists Neil Cummings and Marysia Lewandowska have attempted to collect printed material - not commercially available - produced by local and national clubs, societies, hobbyists, collectors, enthusiasts and associations. Framed by the turning of the new millennium, the collection represents the interests and activities, the hopes and aspirations of a vast and varied society, generally invisible amongst the breathless flow of the professionally mediated. The collection opens a parallel space of publication - a space where representatives no longer speak on your behalf - but where the quiet passions of social life find form. The exhibition, curated from a thousand journals, promises an encounter between the Heritage Retailing, Journal of Bee Keepers, Bishops Crescent News, Collectors gazette, Grapevine, Feathered World, The Jester, The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and the Vampire Society Newsletter. The collection is tinged with nostalgia, it may be your last chance to see such printed matter before its inevitable replacement by digital means of distribution, via on-line news groups, chat spaces and network noticeboards. Not Hansard reflects the rich and sumptuous texture of the 'everyday'. An environment of curiosity - produced through generosity of the donated publications - emerges as a sliver from the avalanche, momentarily arranged.

These works are a continuation of the artist's interest in the changing sense of place and the art of storytelling and translation. The Spanish 19th century novelist and sometime translator, Senito Perez Galdos, is at the centre of the exhibition and of primary interest to the artist, manifesting itself through the various pieces in the exhibition. Juan Cruz's works are carefully constructed. They are created in a way that the viewer must unravel through visual clues. Cruz's work is self-aware and poetic. The works in the exhibition include two sound pieces which engage the idea of translation; a light installation which is supported by a lengthy title, taken from a Charles Dickens' novel and acts as both the work and explanation to the viewer; a school bell primed to ring in the gallery at four o'clock every day questions the idea of a sense of place, while the title again acts as both the work and the explanation through the artist's own translation of a paragraph from a Galdos' novel; and a wall drawing, comprising ten texts, taken from the artist's own translation of novels by Galdos. We Are Going to Tell Lies invites the viewer to engage in a process of unravelling preconceived ideas of place, tales, and interpretation. Juan Cruz was awarded an Artist Fellowship by Kettles' Yard, Cambridge and is undertaking his residency at Girton College, University of Cambridge. He won, in 1999, a Paul Hamlyn Foundation award. Juan Cruz has been chosen by The Daily Telegraph (31.12.99) as the artist of the 21st Century which is part of a list of twelve new names to watch, each promising to take the arts forward in new directions.

Art in Ruins here aim to problematize any easy consumption of ""political art"" and by extending the concept of the readymade in art into the realm of the 'political' world (of competing forces), Art in Ruins seek to recover the lost political moment of conceptual art through its re-use as generic form. These re-makes, as much homage as critique, also point to the ironic fate of the radical impulse of the democratisation of the aesthetic implied by the very concept of modernism and the avant-garde, as the aestheticization of everyday life of consumer society where both art and life, rather than sites of conflict, become the (digital) manipulation of images and the political management of appearances.

These works stake out a path and direction that Wood and Harrison can claim as very much their own. Translating the clarity and economy of their single screen pieces for a larger gallery area was always likely to prove a significant challenge for their work and this exhibition can possibly be thought of as the point when Wood and Harrison really start hitting their stride.A Film and Video Umbrella touring exhibition in association with firstsite and John Hansard Gallery, funded by Arts Council of England.",1833; 1834; 1835

In their voracious uses of furniture, artists have taken both approaches: from the poetic associations of Dadaist and Surrealist readymades, to the Pop flippancy of Robert Rauschenberg's painted bed. Current work displays a fascination with low-key domesticity as a generalised reaction to the grand artistic gestures of Modernity. The exhibition Furniture, rather than attempting to encompass every artistic motivation for using or referencing furniture, focuses on two key aspects. First, it addresses the variant modes in which furniture, sometimes despite itself, works within art in a gallery setting as an index of social and historical meaning (e.g. Nicholas Alvis Vega, Amikam Toren, Thomas GrOnfeld). Secondly, it considers the role of interior decor and furnishing as a nuance or texture within non-functional sculptural form, through the use of specific materials, layering artworks with formal complexity (e.g. Matthew Tickle, Gerard Williams, Nina Saunders). Much of the work in Furniture shares a fugitive status, drifting between familiarity and strangeness. As a display of furniture and an installation of works, Furniture also generates tensions between the domestic and institutional wherein items which might normally be placed in the home, or which might otherwise never be seen combined, are introduced in the contempletive space of the gallery setting. Furniture is curated by Paul Heber-Percy in association with Richard Salmon Gallery and the John Hansard Gallery",1513; 1514; 1515; 1516; 1517; 1518; 1519; 1520; 1521; 1522; 1523; 1524; 1525; 1526; 1527; 1528; 1529; 1530; 1531; 1532; 1533; 1534; 1535; 1536; 1537; 1538; 1539; 1831; 1832

The exhibition will primarily feature new works by the new wave of British 'Photo-Realists', but will also provide glimpses into past manifestations of Photo-Realist work from the 1970's and 80's. Curating an exhibition of photo-style work we will be considering photography in its absence, using the space of photography to highlight the parallel, marginal tradition of the photographic gallery, and its changing role within contemporary culture. By removing photography from the photographic gallery and replacing it with objects which are copies or implied replicas of photographs, the exhibition inverts the traditional ordering of the authentic and the copy, evoking the demonic history of photography's relation to Fine Art.

Objects float on the canvas and sweep over linear hues while only using two or three colours per painting.

Jorge Molder is both a prominent Portuguese artist and an outstanding contemporary photographer. This exhibition features his two most recent series, Anatomy and Boxing 1997 and Corredor 1998. The most substantial of which, Anatomy and Boxing revolves around the self-portrait. The artist is subject and allows himself to examine both life and death. The body becomes a stage or platform of confrontation for analysis through the emphasises of light and shadow, extreme angles and off centre composition in an elegant and visual language. Faced with a series of enlarged photos the viewer is confronted with an intimacy at both the psychological and physical levels. The scale of the pieces evokes the cinematic screen while their occupation of the space lends them a sculptural dimension. The viewer's physical proximity and consequent involvement in the space of the work are actively sought. Jorge Molder lives and works in Lisbon. His work is shown internationally, and is represented in private collections around the world. He has published several individual books of photography. The exhibition has been curated by Susan Copping, an independent Curator, based in London in association with Portugal 600 - a British Foundation whose purpose is to promote the arts and culture of Portugal in the UK & Ireland.This exhibition has been made possible through kind assistance of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, UK, The Contempor Art Institute of the Portuguese Ministery of Culture, The Luso-American Contemporary Art Collection, Lisbon, The Portuguese Centre of Photography, Porto and is being presented in association with Visiting Arts.",1420; 1421

Each consists of a carefully crafted shelf upon which are placed a number of everyday objects. Because the works utilize such simple and similar elements, they create a generic form - rather like a haiku or sonnet form in poetry. The works become meaningful in terms of the objects' relationship to the shelves, and the relationship of one object to another. The power of these relationships is further enhanced by being able to compare one work with another, and this is a first opportunity to see such a collection in Britain. The exhibition has been organised in collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art, Vienna, and has been funded by the Arts Council International Initiatives Fund and the Henry Moore Foundation.

Shown at the John Hansard Gallery in a new and much expanded form, Geneva Express fills the main exhibition area of the gallery with the projected image of a jumbo jet hauling itself into the air.Shot from the end of the runway at Gatwick Airport and following a single plane as it moves back and forth between Gatwick and JFK, New York, Geneva Express recreates the sublime, and indeed the visceral, effect of a take-off experienced at close quarters. This greatly emphasises the miraculous aspect of modern mass air travel - making barely credible the fact that thousands of such take-offs occur routinely each day. In addition to the protection there are clusters of tiny 3"" LeD video screens, their arrangement alluding to the lights of the runway and the rows of video screens showing in-flight movies on the plane themselves. These miniature screens present the 'micro-dramas ' which can be witnessed at any moment during the airport's 24 hour day and dramas that are repeated anew every lime an aircraft lands or takes-off The airport is now commonly thought of as a 'non-place' when in fact it i, a space charged with a heightened drama of the everyday, a drama which is strangely repeated over and over. Geneva Express isolates these moments of extreme intensity, the point of take-off, the moment travellers arrive to be met by friends, lovers, etc., and contrasts them with the superstructure of banality that surrounds flight, which at its most basic consists of the movement of a single object between two fixed points and the processing of passengers at either end.Graham Ellard and Stephen Johnstone have collaborated on installations and digital work since 1993 and have shown their work in museums and galleries across Europe and Australia including The Tate Gallery, Liverpool, The Pompidou Centre, Paris, The Tramway, Glasgow, and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney.

Playing on our tendency to describe by association, to identify using names or forms, Crumplin's work appears as an accident which seems to be figurative. Since 1969, the artist has consistently made work in which one part relates to, or derives from another, and that uses chance operations as part of the process. Using cotton canvas, Colin Crumplin spreads paint by hand and is usually restricted to red, yellow, blue, black and white. The canvas is folded in half and then opened to reveal a monoprint, which the artist refers to as a 'start'. This 'start' might then immediately suggest a figurative image, but more often, and through a long period of scrutiny, an image is identified. When this occurs, Crumplin then plans the second part of the painting. This is a representation of an image suggested by, or relating to, some aspect of the first panel. Some are painted from found images, some from photographs. The images range from depictions of celebration to disaster, from natural phenomena - biological and botanical - to images of urban conflict. These two panels are then hung as one complete piece. Colin Crumplin is Reader in Fine Art at Bath College of Higher Education. In 1994 he curated the exhibition 'Chance, Choice, and Irony' for the John Hansard Gallery and Todd Gallery, London. He is now working on a touring group exhibition 'Second Nature'.

This exhibition is about the occurrence of repetition and the obsessional in contemporary art. The curators have sought, in conjunction with the artists in the exhibition, to identify particular modes of making and studio working practices which employ these two ideas in a variety of configurations.

The exhibition has been developed and expanded for its showing at the John Hansard Gallery, with many of the artists producing work especially for the show. The exhibition examines how abstract painting of the sixties has influenced many artists working today. Trends in painting, as in all areas of contemporary culture, appear to have gone full circle, and the sixties are back in vogue. But artists are inhabiting a very different world, realising that the utopian dreams of previous generations have turned to empty promises. Many artists are now taking a critical look at recent history. The contemporary painters in this exhibition (Jane Harris, Gerard Hemsworth, Richard Kirwan, Neil Misrahi, Yinka Shonibare, Michael Stubbs, Daniel Sturgis and Mandy Ure) will be exhibiting alongside more historic works from the sixties (early works by Robyn Denny, Kenneth Martin, Jeremy Moon and Bridget Riley). The themes of repetition and order employed in the past are being reassessed today. The 'purity' of abstraction is being thrown into a world where figurative readings are invited and welcomed. The exhibition presents an art which was exciting and vibrant and has been imbued with a new vitality and relevance.

With wit, irony and sensitivity, the artists adopt a variety of strategies - taking them from the studio, onto the street, to market stall, into the factory, into the nightclub, and down the digital highway - to investigate the private and public space of our existence. An increasing number of artists have made sorties into the rich territory of community, and at their best they have respected both the integrity of their own working practices and the complexity of the communities with which they collaborate. Often they succeed in being rebellious and funny too. Part of the fascination with the topic may be seen as a response to the lingering legacy from Romanticism, which generated the idea of the artist as isolated and visionary individual, at the opposite pole from community�۪s sense of inclusion and participation.�۝The exhibition brings together a fascinating range of artists, from London, Paris, Turin, and New York, though simultaneously, a number of the artists laid claim to links, through parentage and birth, to other geographical locations such as Nigeria and Russia. The artists themselves came from different artistic communities - Shonibare and Wearing were perhaps identified with the yBa grouping of practitioners, who were at the time beginning to take hold (and a certain control) of the British art world. Other artists, such as Denzil Forrester, were longtime practitioners for whom the process of painting was hugely important. Other artists in the exhibition came from other important international centres of art, such as Paris and New York.The exhibition was organised by Andrew Patrizio of National Touring Exhibitions, and Richard Hylton, of Oldham Art Gallery.

The majority of the artists, however, explore the deserts of North Africa and Arabia. These are the same places explored and charted by many of the Nineteenth and early Twentieth Century travellers and writers whose experiences and visions contribute to the image of the desert as a symbolic space within European culture. The image of the desert created by many such writers was based, to a great extent, on a European view of the Romantic 'other' which, unfortunately, could not escape the infection of colonialism. The need to idealise nature, ancient beliefs and the exotic in many of these writings, therefore, speaks most loudly of Western desire. Others, however, explore the barren desert as a more complex and layered space, rich and fertile with other possible symbolic readings: the desert is a place of metaphysical experience; a melancholic space of indifference; a site of death, disappearance and dissolution; a landscape of grains that refuse to be fixed. A John Hansard Gallery exhibition, curated by Jim Harold additionally shown at London Gallery 12 April - 19 May 1996.",2007; 2008; 2009; 2010; 2011; 2012; 2013; 2014; 2015; 2016; 2017; 2018; 2019; 2020; 2021

The exhibition is taking place in two venues. The first being the Arsenale Medicei in Pisa, which is a very large industrial space, compared with the more compact and intimate exhibition space of the John Hansard Gallery. For each venue the artists have created new pieces which have been a response to both each other's work and to the respective venue. Consequently the two resulting exhibitions also address curatorial concerns including questions of presentation and display.The whole project will be documented through a publication that will contain installation photographs from both exhibitions.

1995_9_CRUDE_THINKING,1995,26/09/1995,11/11/1995,Richard Nonas: Crude Thinking / Thick Making,Richard Nonas,841,"Richard Nonas is an internationally renowned sculptor from New York who has shown his work many times in America and Europe (most recently in Sweden), but this is the first time he has undertaken a large scale project in this country. Nonas is one of a group of minimalist and post-minimalist sculptors who include Carl Andre, Richard Serra, Donald Judd and Gordon Matta-Clark. He mostly works on large scale sculptural installations in both gallery spaces and outdoors, often using repeated elements as sculptural motifs. There is seldom any visible manipulation of the material, instead using either the raw material intact, or specially manufactured metal sections. It is the placing of the materials and the use of the space that is the most crucial aspect of the finished work. He uses simple, uncomplex shapes, creating new environments which look as though they may relate to gathering places or ceremonial sites of ancient societies. As Van der Marck has noted about the outdoor works ""Nonas employs four basic space-bounding devices: the incomplete circle, the triangle, the open square and the linear marker. They constitute the simplest definitions of place - the kinds that can be, and usually are, staked out by walking"".For his exhibition at the John Hansard Gallery, Nonas will be creating a floor piece using about 60 railway sleepers and a wall piece using 200 slates that will form one sculptural installation filling the entire gallery space.

They created 'multiples' or identical editions of their work as a reaction to the art establishment, and produced editions ranging from three to thousands. The artists were turning away from the idea of the unique art object to methods of mass  production. Artists such as Roy Lichtenstein, Christo, Joseph Beuys, Mary Martin, Claes Oldenburg and Arman are among the artists from the 1960s shown in this exhibition. Also included in the 1960s work are Gunther Wesler's 'Breathing Object', and Peter Freeman's bar of soap shaped like a Barbara Hepworth sculpture. These are among 70 multiples which have not been shown together since they were acquired by the Arts Council in 1970. Since the late 1980s artists have once more started to produce multiple edition works. As opposed to the 1960s artists who used mass production for idealogical reasons, artists in the 1990s now take mass production for granted and their work has more ironic intentions. Artists such as Damien Hirst, Rachel Whiteread, Jenny Holzer, Lawrence Weiner and Mark Wallinger are once again questioning and expanding on the notion of unique art. It is apparent that artists working today still find the necessity for creativity and mystery in the making of both unique and multiple works of art. The exhibition has been organised by National Touring Exhibitions from the Hayward Gallery in collaboration with the Centre for Contemporary Arts in Glasgow.

The drawings in the exhibition range from the very first scribbled ideas to complete works, and are grouped into themes including: 'The Sculptor as Illustrator' which shows the drawings as independent works of art in their own right: 'Figurative Sculpture from the Academic to the Avant-Garde', which outlines an evolution of ideas concerned with the representation of human form: The impact of the war on sculptural works is illustrated in 'Images of War and Death': 'Abstract Sculpture since the Great War' shows the developments in post-war abstraction and its interests in ethnographic and Futurist influences, and finally in 'Sculpture and the Landscape' the interdependent relationship between sculpture, nature and space is examined. The exhibition brings to light the important role that drawing plays in the conception and formulation of sculptural works.All the drawings are selected from the Collection of Leeds City Art Galleries and were brought together by Dr Terry Friedman, and the Henry Moore Centre for the Study of Sculpture.

1995_5_MEMORY_&_THE,1995,23/05/1995,10/06/1995,"Memory & The Archive: Photographs, Images, Documents",The Mass Observation Archive,811,"This exhibition, which has been conceived and selected by Russell Roberts (University of Sussex Library) presents a body of photographs (approximately 10,000 prints) that formed part of an attempt to record a single day - 14th August 1987.Initially these images came together as part of a photographic competition and each submission bears the time, place, and name of the photographer on the back of the photograph. The final selection of 350 images (out of 100,000 that were submitted), was published as One Day for Life (1987). The winning photographs were chosen as the result of a filtering process, consisting of members from amateur photography clubs, and finally by a celebrity panel of photographers. The book was organised into a number of time zones and themes to produce a profile of everyday life in Britain during the late 1980's. The competition was originally a fund raising event for a number of cancer charities. These images are now located in the Mass-Observation Archive at University of Sussex Library, and are to be considered from the standpoint of Mass-Observation experience and history. As an archive, only 9,000 of the images have been placed within a practical classificatory scheme. The remaining 91,000 are boxed according to region (the original organising principle), and represent an archival challenge to classificatory methods as the photographs often resist simple classification. Memory & The Archive revisits this vast collection with the intention of drawing out, amongst other things, the ethnographic content of these photographs and their potential use as a social and cultural index, Some of the issues raised by this exhibition relate to the popular consumption of photography, generic images, the formation of collective and subjective memory, the photogenic, and definitions of 'taste'. The images for the book reflect, to varying degrees, a familiar aesthetic and documentary iconography associated with popular and amateur photography. This final selection is expanded within the exhibition by re-presenting a wider range of the material submitted. Installed in such a way as to invite comparative viewing, assumptions can be drawn about relationships between aesthetic, documentary, and ethnographic values. The exhibition is not a critique of what is 'good' or 'bad' photography, 'professional' or 'amateur', but an exploration of the types of images produced in response to the competition and its objectives. This provides the ground for a cultural analysis on the act of photography itself in relation to conceptions of time, place, and memory.A John Hansard Gallery exhibition.",2145
1995_3_SEARCHING_SOUTH,1995,21/03/1995,13/05/1995,Arturo Duclos and Jorge Macchi: Searching South,Arturo Duclos; Jorge Macchi,809; 810,"Arturo Duclos and Jorge Macchi are two South American artists from Chile and Argentina respectively. Both have lived through turbulent and distressing times in their own countries, something that has had a profound effect on their work. Arturo Duclos is a painter who uses his own personal language of signs and images. His paintings work as fragmented associations of ideas, each element capable of being read separately or as a whole. His work is autobiographical, and contains a common internal thread which unites his work and enables him to continue his discourse beyond the limits of any one painting into the next. Duclos' paintings are a representation of the cosmos, a fusion of myth and reality. He uses painting with the obsession of an alchemist, reaching the viewer through accumulation and repetition. The paintings are visual stories which use text and both religious and political symbols. Duclos manages to tell his own individual history and at the same time transmute it into a collective one. Jorge Macchi is an artist who has worked in a variety of media including sculpture, painting and installation, he would often use waste materials and assemble them in a rough and primitive way, sometimes using deliberately poor craftsmanship. They would often take the form of triptychs or temples, giving them a very religious and ritualistic appearance. Macchis' more recent work has become increasingly conceptual and more professionally made. He continues to use domestic and ready made objects, creating an image by painting or changing the nature of the object. In his last two exhibitions Macchi has changed from investigating the past, to concerning himself with the present, and working towards a new and uncertain future.This exhibition has been organised by the John Hansard Gallery and curated by Mario Flecha with financial assistance from the Arts Council of England.

In addition to his work as an artist he is a writer, publisher, critic and curator (he was the founding editor of the journal 'Third Text'). Throughout his long and successful career as an artist he has used a broad range of media including painting, sculpture, performance and photography. He considers both his work as an artist and his work in the other areas as part of one cohesive whole. This exhibition concentrates on Araeen's two-dimensional works that he developed in the eighties as a unique art form of his own. The works usually consist of nine panels arranged in a symmetrical grid in which both painting and photography (often shots taken from a television screen) are juxtaposed in a way that highlight and critique the prevailing dominant art system. Recently Araeen began to use live television as a central device in his nine-grid system. The power and absurdity of television's dominant cultural role is shown to reflect an aspect of modern life that has not yet been articulated by many artists.The exhibition was organised and first shown by the South London Gallery, and received special funding from the London Arts Board.",2125; 2126; 2127; 2128; 2129; 2130; 2131; 2132; 2133; 2134; 2135; 2136

They all live and work in Prague. The work shown utilises a range of media spanning from more traditional materials, to conceptual pieces. Generally artists in the Czech Republic have worked in a more individual way, less affected by art movements in Western Europe, such as postmodernism, conceptualism or expressionism. Instead, their main influences have been the environment within the former Czechoslovakia and occasional images of 'western' art reproduced in books or magazines, although throughout the eighties some artists did become more informed about other artists and movements outside their own country. The work reflects the changing sensibilities of contemporary Czech art since the dislocation of the former Czechoslovakia. Milena Dopitiva's work is mixed media, often combining photographs with objects sometimes made of, or covered with wool. The work is feminine and often relates to herself and her twin sister. Ivan Kafka's work relates to the environment and takes the form of installation. His works are aesthetic and sensitive, often created with delicate materials and intricate constructions. Petr Nikl works in a variety of mediums: painting, sculpture and drawings, all of which are meticulously executed. The paintings reveal Nikl's fantasy world with images that are often suspended in a void, or flat surface, as if floating. Vaclav Stratil's work takes the form of combineddrawings and photographs. The drawings are very laboured and worked on at great length. The artist creates in an obsessive, fanatical way, but the work always displays an ironic detachment.This exhibition was first shown at the South London Gallery and was organised by Susan Copping.

The scratched emulsion of the images draw the viewer to the 'skin' of the image, the site between exterior and interior. A similar duality runs through the photographic works. These bring together half-glimpsed images of nocturnal creatures to give an impression of landscape, often indicated by images of tiny lights reminiscent of night time aerial photographs. The result is a series of evocative and beautifully produced works. Helen Sear is one of Britain's leading artists working with photography. She has exhibited widely in both Britain and many countries abroad, and has also won several awards, scholarships and bursaries. This is the first showing of Helen Sear's new body of work.

A vacuum of censorship surrounded the development of feminism and left-wing demonstrations, the art produced can be seen as an internal debate within a specific artistic context. All of these new ideas and attitudes happened simultaneously with other international art forms such as Performance Art, Land Art and Arte Povera, and this surge of energy in Catalonia was made all the more intense by the anticipated political and social change that would come with the end of Franco's regime. The exhibition has been organised in collaboration with Cornerhouse, Manchester. It has been curated by Stephen Snoddy and Pilar Parcerisas, and includes much of the artists' early work. The exhibition consists of a wide variety of works including documents, photographs, objects, montage and installation from the period 1969 - 1981. The work is more about the sensual than the philosphical, and expresses the vitality, energy and independence of the Catalan personality.This exhibition has received special funding from The Arts Council of England, Visiting Arts and the Departament de Cultura de la Generalitat de Catalunya.",2344; 2345; 2346; 2347; 2348; 2349; 2350; 2351; 2352; 2353; 2354; 2355; 2356; 2357; 2358; 2359; 2360; 2361; 2362; 2363; 2364; 2365; 2366; 2367; 2368; 2369; 2370; 2371; 2372; 2373; 2374; 2375; 2376; 2377; 2378; 2379; 2380; 2381; 2382; 2383; 2384; 2385; 2386; 2387; 2388; 2389; 2390; 2391; 2392; 2393; 2394; 2395; 2396; 2397; 2398; 2399; 2400; 2401; 2402

Evolving from a base in Moscow conceptual art, they use 'found photography' to manipulate aspects of the photographic reality of the old Soviet Union, while refusing conventional positions of 'authorship' or 'originators' of their work. Boris Mikailov (b. 1938), the oldest of the group, who has shown recently at MOMA New York, developed his influential 'luriki' from the folk custom of colouring and rearranging old snapshot photographs to form memorabilia of dead or unknown persons. Gennady Gushchin (b. 1940), has for twenty years been elaborating an 'alternative museum' of Russian and Soviet 'old master' paintings transformed by a new kind of montage technique. The Moscow artists Alexei Shulgin (b. 1963) and Vladimir Kupreanov (b. 1954) take anonymous 'amateur' photographs and manipulate them by experimental techniques of fragmentation, repetition, crumpling, vibrating, doubling or re-framing. Russia's Documenta artist Maria Serebriakova (b. 1965), is concerned here with motifs of landscape and furniture; while the St Petersburg artists Victoria Buivid (b. 1962) and Ludmilla Fedorenko (b. 1961) use variations in 'ready-made' or 'found' photography to re-stage that which has been lost once, but is now recuperated against the pressure of time and change. PHOTO-reclamation is an important exhibition of new art from a nation partly within the orbit of international contemporary art, yet partly outside it. It presents for the first time outside Russia or the USA a type of photographic art practice that extends the radical experiment of Rodchenko and Petrusov in a post-communist atmosphere.PHOTO-reclamation is curated by Brandon Taylor. There is a 76-page catalogue with texts on Russian photo-art by Brandon Taylor and Tatiana Salzirn and full documentary information on the artists.The exhibition has been financially assisted by the Arts Council of England and Visiting Arts.",2403; 2404; 2405; 2406; 2407; 2408; 2409; 2410; 2411; 2412; 2413; 2414; 2415; 2416; 2417; 2418; 2419; 2420; 2421; 2422; 2423; 2424; 2425; 2426; 2427; 2428; 2429; 2430; 2431; 2432; 2433; 2434

The title of the exhibition is self-explanatory; the exhibition focuses on work which is made through the use of chance and choice, as in the creating and using of accidents and serendipity as a starting process to making the work. In many cases the work quotes or refers to the work of others, and it is this sense that irony occurs. In many ways it is an exhibition about new approaches to painting, and those works in the exhibition which are not paintings set the parameters into which the paintings fall. The paintings themselves look as if they could have been made several decades ago, but in fact are intended to parody ideas of our recent art historical past. Two of the artists are British (Fiona Rae and Colin Crumplin), one is French (Bernard Frize) and the rest are from the United States. Two of the American artists 'have never been seen in Britain (Matthew Weinstein and David Reed) and one other (Jonathan Lasker) had not been seen until the painting exhibition currently at the Hayward Gallery.The exhibition is selected by Colin Crumplin, and organised by the Todd Gallery and John Hansard Gallery.

1994_3_THE_SCAR,1994,08/03/1994,16/04/1994,John Goto: The Scar,John Goto,854,"John Goto is an artist who deals with history. He is working on an  epic project which will consist of seven 'tales' of the twentieth century, and will be completed by the year 2000. (The first of these was Terezin shown at the John Hansard Gallery in 1989). The new series is called The Scar and is set during the momentous events which took place in Europe during the final months of 1989, and takes the form of a love story. The exhibition consists of a group of interrelated photographic polyptychs, which trace the journey of a woman through the lowlands of eastern England. She is distracted throughout her journey by thoughts of her past in Prague and the man who inhabited her life there. In the background are news reports of the political events taking place in central Europe, these aid her memory as she tries to reconstruct and give meaning to that distinct time and place that are her own past.A book has been published to accompany this exhibition, published by Benjamin Rhodes Gallery, London. It is a collaborative book between John Goto and the Croatian writer Durga Otizan, who has written two short stories around the theme of The Scar which reflect on the ensuing turmoil, sacrifice and barbarism that have engulfed her own country as a result of the changes begun in 1989. This exhibition has been organised by Benjamin Rhodes Gallery in association with John Hansard Gallery, and has been supported by Oxford Brookes University.",2317; 2318; 2319; 2320; 2321; 2322; 2323; 2324; 2325; 2326; 2327; 2328; 2329; 2330; 2331; 2332

The resulting paintings and drawings combine the mythology and geography of the region, using ores from the mine as pigments which perfectly capture the visual feel of the area. Grater uses several references within the work - images from electron microscopes, geographical maps, aboriginal markings and rituals. He produces mysterious work that can offer ambiguous and multi-faceted readings, which prompt curiosity and instinctual responses. He is fascinated by shape and form, which he culls from both natural and man-made sources. References to man's imprint on the land, and to the traces left by natural forces on the landscape are both equally resonant.The exhibition has been organised by Pratt Contemporary Art in collaboration with John Hansard Gallery, and touring to Wolverhampton Museum and Art Gallery, Harris Museum, Preston, and the Royal Cornwall Museum, Truro.

1993_11_RESERVOIR,1993,17/11/1993,22/12/1993,Judith Goddard: Reservoir,Judith Goddard,916,"Judith Goddard is one of Britain's most important artists working with video. She has exhibited widely in Britain and internationally, building up a strong body of work that reveals a long-term interest in the elemental forces of light and electricity. This is the first showing of Reservoir - a remarkable new installation that combines the alchemical and technological, mixing the natural elements of fire and water with video technology and 19th century electrical machinery. The work occupies two spaces, one white, the other black. The white space:- Entering the room you are faced with a floor to ceiling wall projection of a waterfall, you hear its powerful roar. It runs continuously, but not in real time, and so appears to travel upwards - 'against nature'. Walking into the space you trigger a Wimshurst machine, thereby generating an electrical spark. The lightning spark is seen for a matter of seconds flashing across the whole screen, crashing into the image of the running water, the sound of the crack interrupting the rushing roaring sound of the waterfall. The black space:- Your initial sensation on entering this room is of complete blackness, haunted by the cavernous, amplified sound of dripping water. Moving into the space triggers a strobe, illuminating three continuous drip's of water falling from the ceiling into a flat stainless steel tray. The intermittent light from the strobe creates an illusion that each drop of water caught in its flicker is absolutely stationary in defiance of gravity. On the other side of the room, three LCD televisions suspended in space by steel cable, depict an electrocardiogram. It's signal traces from left to right across the three screens. Rhythmically and intermittently, the signal is interrupted by images of a gender reassignment operation which sweeps across the screens. The exhibition explores the relationships, both real and symbolic between fire and water, conjuring up the presence of the primordial - birth, life, sex and death. It has been funded by the Arts Council, and organised in conjunction with Moviola. The work will subsequently form part of a major video installation in Lisbon next year, which includes the work of Nam Jun Paik, Gary Hill and Bill Viola.",2530

The effect is often to reduce important cultural differences, and even more so regional differences, and is dominated by the markets of Europe's cities. Southampton is a city in a region of England in close proximity to London, but with distinct cultural differences from it. This exhibition grew out of an increasing familiarity with the artists of the Girona region, who have kept abreast of developments in contemporary art, but have retained a strong regional identity. Such an exhibition therefore has much to teach us about retaining cultural diversity in our increasingly homogenous world. Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of contemporary art from Girona is the faith in traditional disciplines; painting, drawing and sculpture, as the canons from which innovation and experimentation can swing. Much of the International Style has abandoned the traditional disciplines to the point where painting and sculpture have ceased to exist, and whereby innovation is all, but a relationship to tradition is lost, possibly forever. The art of Girona has retained strong links with artisanship, and many artists will work to order in a number of media, taking on public commissions, and have no fear about adapting their particular approach to decoration or ornament. These artists have retained that essentially Catalan quality of a relationship to abstraction, and finding a voice through bright and strong colour, subtle uses of texture, and simple, vibrant form. This is still essentially a sensuous approach to making art.An exhibition jointly organised by the John Hansard Gallery and the Winchester Gallery, and subsequently touring to Europe.

1993_8_AIRMAIL_PAINTINGS,1993,17/08/1993,18/09/1993,Eugenio Dittborn: Airmail Paintings,Eugenio Dittborn,915,"Eugenio Dittborn is a Chilean artist who lives and works in Santiago de Chile. He has exhibited  in ""Transcontinental: nine Latin American artists"" in Birmingham and Manchester, and also participated in the recent Documenta 9 at Kassel in Germany. Since 1984 Dittborn has been making what he calls Airmail Paintings. He works on large sheets of synthetic white non-woven material which he paints, photographically prints, silkscreens, sometimes stitches or embroiders, then folds and puts into specially designed envelopes and sends through the airmail to the place they are to be exhibited . They are then taken out, unfolded and hung. The envelopes, with their postmarks and stamps, and with a list of all the painting's previous journeys are also hung alongside. For Dittborn, this act has allowed him to infiltrate the international western artworld without the complex infrastructure that is normally necessary. An artist from a poor country can transmit a simple idea using simple means, and in so doing uses deprivation as a way of challenging the privilege of the west. In this way he has created something huge out of almost nothing - from small envelopes have sprung large exhibitions of large scale works in major museums all over the world. He calls the works his 'trojan horse'. The works are then repacked and transported to their next destination, each venue marked on the envelope. Amongst his many concerns is the concept of the passing of time. Often a work consists of a photograph of the same scene separated by a few seconds, or else similar incidents separated by thousands of years, such as the bog man dug up intact after 2000 years next to an image of a Pinochet victim dug up in 1990, whose body had been preserved by the sand over twenty years. Another interest is himself, events in his life, and events affecting his family and those close to him. Important family moments are celebrated and remembered. These are placed next to images of a more general, but still personal nature - the situation in Latin America, and the recent history of Chile in particular.This exhibition has been organised and previousely shown by the ICA, who have published, in association with Witte de With, Rotterdam, a Spanish/English monograph 'Mapa: The Airmail Paintings of Euginio Dittborn'. It has been awarded an Arts Council of Great Britain publication Grant.

This exhibition, organised by Ffotogallery and ORIEL, Cardiff, in association with John Hansard Gallery, presents a thematic selection of these works for the first time.Alongside the black and white, colour, photo-montage and photo-text assemblage works, are some large scale photo-diptych and triptychs, made especially for the exhibition. These works will use the gallery space to explore the relationship between the 'actor' and the 'audience'. Breakwell has particularly drawn on his fascination with Twins, their uncanny likeness and intuitive powers of mutual communication, in order to investigate further the idea of the 'hidden self. The making of these works has been the subject of a forty minute documentary made and shown by HTV in Wales.

At the James Hockey Gallery, Blacker has over a period of many weeks made a large scale installation related to the proportions of the gallery space. It consists of a series of screens punctuating the long featureless space. The front of each screen appears cinematic, whilst the structural support holding each screen is clearly visible from behind. The piece deals with fantasy and reality through our relationship to the cinema screen. At the John Hansard Gallery are a series of recent works of discrete small scale sculptures.

The exhibition shows for the first time in Britain the work of three women artists who work with both film and photography. What unites them is their use of a technically conditioned medium. All three emphasise, in their own way, the process of creating images. They lay stress on construction, where individual photographic shots, the real image, are only a starting point for a transformation using phototechnical means.Dorte Eissfeldt is currently Professor for Art\Photography at the Hochshule fur Bildende  Kunste in Braunschweig. She takes great pleasure in the practical aspects of her work, the darkroom is the place where images are created. It is the process of shaping and composing that fascinates her. Dorte Eissfeldt's photographic works are always thematically related and titled. These titles, although alluding to that presented, are supplementary rather than part of the work. Her contradiction of conventional photographic portraiture not only leads to the question of how these photo-images were generated, but also to that of their subject's significance. Silke Grossmann has worked as a freelance photographer and film-maker since 1975. Her work distances itself from current trends. One of its basic themes is the interrelation of space and the persons within it. Her figures are mostly women, who occupy the photographically isolated space with their own movements and bodies. Silke Grossmann processes the direct, detail-like takes either as positives or as negatives, creating new space through the use of different lighting effects. Dore O. is more widely known as a film-maker, her interest in photography only emerging towards the end of the 1970's, since then she has worked mainly with Polaroids. The instantaneousness of the technique and the special characteristics of its emulsion allow Dore O. to destroy the image produced. The 'damaged' and in part overpainted Polaroids are then rephotographed and enlarged into a medium to monumental format. Dore O. sees photography as an extension of her cinematographic work and has developed a method in which the photographic process itself becomes the object of her production.This show is a touring exhibition organised by the Goethe Institut in London, and curated by Ute Eskildsen, Director of the Photographic Collection at the Folkgang Museum, Essen.

The show�۪s title is straightforward, referring to its inspiration and geographical context and refers to the Hertford Canal, which branches off the Grand Union canal system. The work is site-specific, declaring itself to be in and about a particular place; however, it precipitates thoughtful generalisations. Through Maguire�۪s work the canal becomes an analogy for our interaction with the world such as the confrontations and impositions that shape our reality.Towards the bottom of each painting in this series, breaking the symmetry, are brush strokes that mimic the movement of water.

Many meanings can be drawn from the acts of selection, re-creation and re-contextualisation on which this exhibition focuses. Refusing to Surface begins with works from post Dada and early Pop art, which sets a context to a great breadth of purpose in current art that utilises everyday objects. The earliest piece is by Yves Klein, entitled ""Blue Globe"" (1959), but also includes a Richard Hamilton ""Lux"" drawing (1973) an early Joan Brossa (1969) and Tony Carter's water-colour on a pound note (1969). Later works by the latter three are also included. Refusing to Surface includes purposefully dumb arrangements by artists such as Ange Leccia, Haim Steinbach and PhiIippe Cazal.

1992_8_FAMILIARS,1992,04/08/1992,12/19/1992,Hamad Butt: Familiars,Hamad Butt,967,"Hamad Butt's sculpture involves a complex overlay of forms, ideas and contexts. Shown in 1990 at Milch in London, Transmission refered to scriptural exegesis, science fiction and AIDS. Using protective goggles, visitors felt that apocalypse was being postponed indefinitely. A similar sense of 'kill or cure' informs his new installation Familiars. Displaying halogens - iodine, bromine and chlorine - in solid, liquid and gaseous form respectively, the artist investigates problems of sexuality, medicine, not least order. The three parts (Substance Sublimation Unit, Hypostasis and Cradle) embody research into contemporary physics. (The measurement of entropy in the sublimation and recrystallisation of iodine had not been properly investigated until Butt brought it to the attention of Dr Garry Rumbles at Imperial College, London). Above all, it has overtones of psychoanalysis, one early model of the mind and its motions. In true alchemical fashion, Butt's 'metachemics', his private equivalent to metaphysics, treats changes in the properties of matter as a prelude to transmutation or even destruction. For despite its earthy humor and irreverent play, as giant glass bubbles of dangerous chlorine gas are turned into a giant office toy, Familiars hovers on the brink not of apocalypse but of total destruction. Yet how difficult it is to confront annihilation when faced with the results of allotropy, with what Joyce's Stephen Dedalus called ""the ineluctable modality of the visible"". This exhibition has been jointly organised by John Hansard Gallery, Southampton and Milch, London, with financial support from London Arts Board, and sponsorship from Pacegrove Ltd, and Bibby Sterilin.",2655; 3870; 3871

In their candid references to homosexuality, Lexier and Fabo rupture the conventional code of silence which has continued to circumscribe and mask gay culture. Lexier is represented in the exhibition by a recently completed group of works embodying quotes from gay literature; City of Night by John Rechy (1989); Quiet Fire: Memoirs of Older Gay Men (1989), and two new works specifically for this exhibition, one of which is derived from the memoirs of the British writer J .R.Ackerly, My Father and Myself (1991). In all four works Lexier employs conventional typefaces executed in laser-cut steel as wall or floor mounted and back-lit reliefs. Fabo presents us with an installation entitled ""Aphasia"", comprising over 300 individual drawings executed with black sumi-ink on unframed cards. Ranging from abbreviated notations to highly detailed renderings, ""Aphasia"" presents a chaotic array of image and text, where figurative motifs are interspersed with hand-lettered calligraphic text, read like unbound pages from a book. Andy Fabo is also well known as a filmmaker and he has collaborated with fellow Canadian Michael Balser on a number of works which were shown at the Institute of Contemporary Arts earlier this year.This exhibition has been organised and shown by the Visual Arts Unit at Canada House, Trafalgar Square, and has also been shown at Chapter Arts Centre, Cardiff.

Suspended States is the culmination of a work begun in 1986. At first it appears to trace a circuitous route through the conventions of still life photography, in relation to the recurring subject, a prosaic rock. The shifting compositions of the subject conjure up a range of references and associations including those of wealth and possession, architectural and territorial, historical and geological, which operate through various photographic genres: documentary, scientific and advertising photography for example. Suspended States consists of 39 framed cibachrome prints assembled in clusters of four or five images, like constellations in the sky. While each image has its own particular meaning and identity, it is only when read collectively that a complex set of 'stories' is revealed.In parallel with the exhibition, Suspended States also appears as an publication, reproducing each of the constellations in full colour, with an essay by writer and critic, Susan Butler.

It accompanies a major conference to be held in the gallery on 18/19 July entitled 'Preserving the Jewish Heritage'. Sharon Chazan graduated from the Documentary Photography course at Newport School of Art in 1987 and began almost immediately to undertake a major project to document ethnic minorities. She began, spurred by her curiosity about her own Jewish background, to make an extensive survey of the Jewish East End of London. Her intention was to make a body of photographs and subsequently publish a book that would give an extensive and unique view of the lives of ethnic groups living in Britain. The work was never to be completed because the project was to lead to her tragic death.The images in this exhibition are therefore a fragment of what was to become a unique and ambitious project, but the evidence is that had the work been completed, it would have provided a remarkable photographic portrait. The images themselves have an integrity that comes from a genuine documentary tradition, they demonstrate a unique understanding of form, and often are full of great beauty, pathos and humour. However, the quality that is most responsible for the power of her images is neither her technical ability nor her empathy. She was fearless in her search to get to the heart of situations, to enter territory where photographers rarely venture. During her student days she ventured into a mortuary, and to Hell's Angels and gypsy sites. For this project she was able to gain access to circumcision rituals and other religious ceremonies where photographers are rarely allowed. The tragic circumstances of her death are all the more poignant because of the enormous potential that she displayed during her brief career. We have no idea where her career may have taken her, but the pictures in this exhibition, which were printed and mounted by Sharon herself, are a lasting testament to her courage and talent.",4522

"1990_1_PHOTOGRAPHS,_WATERCOLOURS",1990,16/01/1990,10/02/1990,"Wols: Photographs, Watercolours, Etchings",Wols,1330,"A painter, photographer and draughtsman of great delicacy and intensity, Wols (1913-51) was born in Berlin but spent most of his artistic career in Spain and France. Greatly influenced by the Surrealists, his own work brought a decisive influence to bear on the generation of artists which succeeded him. Although he has been described as one of the best known artists of this century, this touring exhibition from the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, Stuttgart, has been timed to coincide with a recent growth of interest in Wols. The exhibition consists of 40 photographs, 11 watercolours, 33 etchings and 2 illustrated books, and is intended to introduce his work to a wider public. Alfred Otto Wolfgang Schulze assumed the pseudonym Wols while working as a photographer in Paris in the 1930s. On the outbreak of war, Wols was arrested and spent over a year in internment camps in France. During this time, he began to work on a broader artistic front, and some of his beautiful small scale drawings date from this period. As a painter, Wols was greatly influenced by the Surrealists, and in particular by Yves Tanguy's illusionistic dream images. Like Tanguy, Wols drew his creations out of fantasy into reality, developing strange narratives, peopled and decorated with dream-like figures and objects.Increasingly, Wols refined these fantastic images into free flowing organic shapes and patterns, until he abandoned Surrealism completely and devoted himself entirely to non-figurative work. His later drawings and watercolours were created spontaneously, their images arising almost directly from the unconscious, yet they were executed with meticulous accuracy and control. He created an abstract pictorial world which was both lyrical and dramatic, menacing and exquisitely beautiful. The rigour and decisiveness of his approach, and the spontaneous precision of his draughtsmanship, ensured that these small scale works are powerfully expressive. Wols developed Surrealism into a non-figurative art. He has come to be regarded as an important pioneer of Art Informel, or Tachism, the post-war European school of lyrical and expressive abstraction, which ran parallel to the development of American abstract expressionism. The exhibition is organised by the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, Stuttgart. The British tour is organised by the Goethe Institute. A fully illustrated catalogue is available, containing an essay by Ewald Rathke.",4421; 4422; 4423; 4424; 4425; 4426; 4427; 4428; 4429; 4430; 4431; 4432; 4433; 4434; 4435; 4436; 4437; 4438; 4439; 4440; 4441; 4442; 4443; 4444; 4445; 4446; 4447; 4448; 4449; 4450; 4451; 4452; 4453

The exhibition focuses on four artists who work in a way that is quieter, more restrained and self disciplined than the gestural work of recent times. None of these artists could be described as minimalist, but each has utilised minimal forms to achieve different ends. Morellet and Richardson-Jones have rejected minimalism and have adopted systematic strategies, devoid of obvious artistic gestures thus encouraging the imaginative input of the viewer. Allsop and Roberts work towards assertion of a third dimension to create a tension between the geometry of the surfaces and solid spacial relationships.

This exhibition focuses on the development and transformation of an idea through the process of working in series. Arturo Di Stefano and Tim Maguire are both painters and Matthias Mansen trained as a painter; this has no doubt influenced their method of working within the conventions of printmaking. Each of these artists has adopted an approach to printmaking which allows the work to maintain a freer and more immediate quality than is often explored in prints. A lack of preoccupation with reproducibility is a quality that is common to the work by all three artists in this exhibition. It is not printmaking as a method of producing copies of an image but rather the use of the medium for its particular qualities. Since the Sixties printmaking has experienced a revival. At a time of accelerating technology it has developed as an autonomous means of expression and can lay claim to a new individuality. Not only does Mansen make woodcuts with tools, wood and paper that do not belong to the traditional process, he also cuts up the blocks and rearranges them to further explore his ideas. Di Stefano also works with woodcuts and in his series 'Return to Ithaca' a single block has been used to create four separate prints that have been built up by cutting away this same block of wood. In his series 'Untitled' Maguire uses lithography as a means of tonal exploration. Here he uses a single lithograph from which a number of proofs have been taken and then reworked with a variety of different materials such as pastel and gouache. Each print is unique and yet as with Di Stefano and Mansen they can collectively add to the viewer's understanding and perception of the work. Arturo Di Stefano is a London based artist. He has a solo exhibition at Pomeroy-Purdy Gallery from 7 September. Tim Maguire is an Australian artist. He is participating in Art And Nature at the Flaxman Gallery from 6 July.

1989_6_PAINTED_SCULPTURE,1989,06/06/1989,15/07/1989,John Edwards: Painted Sculpture,John Edwards,1301,"The John Hansard Gallery commissioned the artist, John Edwards, to construct a 15' steel sculpture to be sited in front of the gallery to herald its entrance. The award came about as the result of a competition and Edwards' proposal was selected for its dramatic use of shape and colour, as well as its quality of traversing the figurative and purely abstract. The opening of this exhibition coincides with the unveiling of the sculpture and the two events celebrate John Edwards' recent explorations into painted sculpture. Like many abstract expressionist painters, Edwards' work needed to address the problem of painting in relation to pictorial space. Whilst many painters reintroduced elements of realism, Edwards continued to investigate the dilemma between implied and actual space. This resulted in a series of small maquettes which were constructed with single sheets of painted board - his paintings had become three dimensional. These complex works carry the purely visual qualities of weight and space and the complexity comes about as the result of the paradox between the perspective of various shapes and the implied spatial relationships of their inherent colours. This exhibition contains many of the initial maquettes, a series of free standing sculptures related to the John Hansard Gallery Sculpture Commission and a series of three dimensional wall works.",4308; 4309; 4310; 4311; 4312; 4313; 4314; 4315; 4316; 4317; 4318; 4319; 4320; 4321; 4322; 4323; 4324; 4325; 4326; 4327; 4328; 4329; 4330; 4331; 4332; 4333; 4334; 4335; 4336; 4337; 4338; 4339; 4340; 4341; 4342; 4343; 4344; 4345

The exhibition comprises small sculptures by thirty international artists and as suc h offers a personal view of contemporary sculptural practice. Winter is concerned that the proliferation of monumental public sculptures may possibly inhibit our appreciation of sculptural values. Such essentially architectonic works daunt us by their scale and engineering qualities. By focus sing on small works we are able to reconsider issues of purely plastic concerns. Skulpturen Republik is intended to be seen as an installation piece in which each sculpture stands on its own plinth within the carefully arranged configuration of the exhibition. It is inspired by the notion of The Republic in which each constituent part retains an element of uniqueness whilst at the same time remaining an integral and essential part of the whole. Together these thirty artists represent an enormous range of sculptural activity. Most pieces are recent works but are underpinned by some influencial earlier works including a chocolate bust by Dieter Roth (1969) and constructions by Oswald Stimm (1959) and Richard Tuttle (1972). Although spanning a wide range of sculptural materials and concerns the work in this exhibition can be seen as being unified and informed by a shift in emphasis which challenges the historical/traditional role of sculptural practice. ,4346; 4347; 4348; 4349; 4350; 4351; 4352; 4353; 4354; 4355; 4356; 4357; 4358; 4359; 4360; 4361; 4362; 4363; 4364; 4365; 4366; 4367; 4368; 4369; 4370; 4371; 4372; 4373; 4374

These performances are often accompanied by other simultaneous events - music and dance, for example, on the ground below. At the same time, Poleskie makes drawings, collages and prints which are in essence proposals for performances that mayor may not take place. These works, often consisting of memorabilia and other material attached to flight charts and maps, describe hypothetical movements through real spaces represented by symbolic means. His fantasies of exploring space; dancing through it on a vast scale, are given substance by these plans and proposals, which vary from the rigorously charted to the impossibly fanciful. In the past he has made a series of 1500 ft arches over the River Maumee (The Rolling River) in Toledo. More recently he has drawn a gigantic rising spiral above the Empire State Building. His exhibition in Southampton is a mixed media installation made especially for the gallery. It will house a large wallwork which is a 35' proposal for a performance over Southampton Docks and the Solent that Poleskie plans to undertake during the Summer of this year.

In so doing, Goto's work explores ways in which one generation might know the experience of another by raising questions of how our present knowledge of past events is constructed.The small garrison town of Terezin lies 60 km. to the north of Prague. In October 1941 the decision was taken by the German authorities to use this fortified town as a transit camp for Jews. From there they were to be transported to 'the East', for most the destination was in fact the death camp of Auschwitz. During the four year history of the Ghetto 141,000 people were interned there, of these only 23,000 survived the war. Early in 1943 the Nazis embarked on an elaborate propaganda exercise to transform Terezin into a 'model ghetto'. The deception involved false shop fronts, the construction of a childrens' playground and the planting of roses. Cultural activities were encouraged including lecture programmes and the formation of choruses and orchestras. All this was against a backdrop of continuing transports and the pervading atmosphere of fear in Terezin. The central character of the Terezin series is based on a Bauhaus graduate who taught drawing to the children there before per deportation in 1944. Andrew Brighton writes (Art & Design) that ""she stands for more than herself, she stands for murdered people and a murdered culture. It is culture that is being re-remembered here and re-made"".The images are large scale photographic constructions involving various layering processes which are intended to parallel those of history itself. John Goto is presently Artist Fellow at Girton College; Kettle's Yard, Cam bridge. His work is also included in 'Blasphemies, Ecstasies and Cried' at the Serpentine Gallery, London from 17 January.",4396; 4397

This exhibition, organised by IKON Gallery, Birmingham, offers the first opportunity to examine his work in depth. It includes key 'structures' of the 1960's, most of which have not been seen before. Their significance to the decade in which they were produced lies not least in their challenge to a widespread misconception that Minimalist art was a purely American phenomenon. at that time. The exhibition will include both floor based and relief work, made of painted steel and wood. Their open construction and often modular format describe space and engender complex rhythmical relationships. In the earliest sculpture Araeen uses a single, coloured ground. Later, precise colour intervals within individual pieces become important. In writing about his early sculpture, Araeen has talked of his intention to devise 'non hierarchical relationships of equal and identical elements'. His engagement with Western Modernism involved concepts such as 'Internationalism' and 'progress' which, for a British artist of Third World origin, can be seen to have particular significance. He began to recognise that the philosophies and tenets within which he was working contributed to 'an aesthetic which insisted that art has nothing to do with the socio- economic and political conditions of a particular people'. As a Black person attempting to work as an artist in Britain! Araeen's growing political involvement in questions of race and culture resulted in radical changes of approach to his art in the 1970's.In 1969, his 'Chakras' (Water discs) event at St Katherines Docks in London involved public participation and, through the 70's, his art took new forms including installation and performance. In recent years, he has produced many impressive works using photographic images, collage and text, in which race, gender and cultural identity are central concerns. Their incorporation of 'history' through reference to, and representation of his own past activity as an artist is indicative of the strategic and interventionist approach to making art which now characterises his work.This retrospective is long overdue acknowledgement of his achievement in doing so.

1988_6_REFLECTIONS_AFTER,1988,01/06/1988,09/07/1988,Anthony Whishaw: Reflections after Las Meninas,Anthony Whishaw,1023,"Anthony Whishaw first visited Spain in 1951 when he was an  impressionable 21 year old. and he has been fascinated by the country and its culture ever since. Not surprisingly perhaps, it was Goya' s extraordinary Black Paintings that obsessed him when he returned to Madrid a few years later. As he was to discover. Velazquez works a slower and more subtle magic. Whishaw's earliest exhibited canvases consisted of painterly renderings of the Spanish countryside and of figures dancing or in repose. By the late '60s. under the influence of American colour-field painting his forms became more abstracted and spatially ambiguous. Colour, usually stained on to the canvas, tended to be gently lyrical. In the 1970s, Whishaw concentrated on seemingly abstract compositions which, though based on specific landscape motifs, relied heavily on memory and imagination to evoke an enigmatic sense of place. As the decade progressed, his works became more richly textured and by the early '80s he was favouring a long horizontal format. It was almost by chance that Velazquez - and the human figure - were reimposed on Whishaw' s consciousness . During 1983-84 he was working on two paintings of interiors. Interior Triptych and Matadero Municipal. when he realised that the small door or window motif present in both had its origins in Velazquez ' s 1656 painting. Las Meninas (The Maids of Honour). which he had last seen in the Prado in 1956 . His curiosity aroused. Whishaw read a number of scholarly articles about the painting. and these inspired him to explore his own responses to the work.",2893; 2894; 2895; 2896; 2897; 2898; 2899; 2900; 2901; 2902; 2903; 2904; 2905; 2906; 2907; 2908; 2909; 2910; 2911; 2912; 2913; 2914; 2915; 2916; 2917; 2918; 2919; 2920; 2921; 2922; 2923; 2924; 2925; 2926; 2927; 2928; 2929; 2930; 2931; 2932; 2933; 2934; 2935; 2936; 2937; 2938; 2939; 2940; 2941; 2942; 2943; 2944; 2945; 2946; 2947; 2948; 2949; 2950; 2951; 2952; 2953; 2954; 2955; 2956; 2957; 2958; 2959; 2960; 2961
1988_4_VERDI_YAHOODA,1988,17/04/1988,21/05/1988,Verdi Yahooda: Uitstallen / Window Dressing,Verdi Yahooda,723,"Verdi Yahooda studied fine arts at Goldsmiths' College and photography at the Royal College of Art; she lives and works in London, and over the last ten years has shown widely in exhibitions around the country. She is represented in many collections in Britain and abroad.Her photographic interests lie in the representation and ordered arrangement of objects (usually in a domestic setting), and the ways in which they can be made to reveal their physical character and latent emotive associations. In some cases these arrangements are casual, or found' , in others the objects have been carefully positioned or sequenced by the photographer. Hers is a precise and meticulous art, and this precision extends to the ritual of photographing itself-the way in which the camera orders and selects a certain configuration of objects to create or expose a particular meaning. Yahooda also emphasises the photograph itself as a physical object, and searches for new ways to present it: this has led her to place photographs on plinth s, to wrap them up to await 'unfolding', and now, as in this show, to present them on a very large scale, as mixed media installations. Verdi Yahooda spent a period in Amsterdam in autumn 1987, and found these concerns strangely mirrored in the endless diversity of the window displays around the city - many of them virtuoso performances in themselves - both in shopfronts and in private houses. The photographs she took there of these intriguing and often bizarre arrangements provided her with a new starting point for an exploration of scale and texture, and of the mysteries of the everyday object, an exploration for which Yahooda sees a parallel ill the dominant Dutch traditions of still life and interior painting. The form of the resulting photoworks reflects both the theme of the works and the individual forms and textures of the objects they depict. The works on show are large, and often involved construction around the photographic image, the use of material or a curtaining device to mirror the theme of the window as a frame or stage, and the object as actors.

This exhibition, organised by the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, Stuttgart, is a survey of 25 German artists who use the Medium of photography either as art or in art. The exhibition does not intend to present a theoretical argument on the place of photography within the realm of art, but rather demonstrates the complex use of the by artists with differing aims and artistic approaches All the artists are currently living and working in West Germany, wit h the exception of Joseph Beuys, who died in 1986. His influence on German art is clearly recognised, and his work broke down traditional boundaries through the use of drawing, installation, performance and photography. The interact:on between painting and photography is demonstrated by the artists such as Dieter Hacker and Gerhard Richter. Hacker has, in addition to his activity as a painter, amassed snap-shots and amateur photographs which are used to create vast collages that subvert meaning and intention. Richter is represented by a photograph of a painting of a photograph, which also questions meaning in the image. The use of photography in performance has been important as a means of making permanent a transient form. Klaus Rinke has used this so extensively that meaning is created through the photograph itself, rather than from the original activity. Meaning is also extended in Rebbeca Horn's fusion of sculpture and performance. The object and the event are brought together in sequential form which remind us of her recurring interest in the passage of time.The exhibition is accompanied by an illustrated catalogue.

1988_1_A_DISQUIETING,1988,19/01/1988,20/02/1988,A Disquieting Suggestion,Richard Forbes; Peter Joseph; Brian Lawtey; Edwina Leapman; John Meadows,998; 999; 1000; 1001; 1002,"It is clearly evident within our increasingly secular culture that every entity or event has to be ascribed a 'meaning' before it is given recognition or is permitted to function. Such a meaning has to be clearly stated and accessible before someone outside of the sphere of meaning can engage in it. Also apparent in today's de-politicised consumer society is that the choice of accepted meanings is itself becoming restricted. More increasingly things are being defined by their 'value' within the functions of that society. Not permissible with such a system is the question of whether value of meaning can be given from a source outside of this system, or indeed whether meaning within these terms is required any way. A consequence of this system is that accepted traditions, languages and other constituents of the system as a whole are in fact never questioned in terms of their value or meaning and are absorbed accordingly by the passive consumer. A problem always facing art in its position within culture and society is that it does not necessarily offer ready meanings, in fact a required function of it is that it resists simple classification. As a consequence, art is always being challenged by a hostile public that feels it is unable to engage with such an uncertain activity. This is particularly the case with ' abstract' art which is popularly criticised as failing to engage with a respondent. What this exhibition of five 'abstract' painters attempts to do is reflect this question of meaning back on the viewer. Most elevating about the works included is, not only the beautiful qualities of colour, light and their presence within the architecture. but their ability to confront the viewer with his or her own presence. The common response to all visual art is to define it in terms of a narrative or some form of closed system of reading. Even with abstract work there is the demand for it to be read in terms of its ""gestural qualities"". Inferred by this is the desire on the part of the respondent to remain passive and be dictated to. The paintings included in this exhibition resist any singular reading of them. Reference to gesture is minimalised and any suggestion of figuration is denied. Composition is symetrical, and spacial reading of their colour is so ambiguous that it is impossible to locate. To achieve such a permanent stasis requires very careful and considered working on the part of the artist.If any specific questions are asked of these paintings, such as how one colour signifies in relationship to another, they are questions with infinite answers, and which act as ciphers for much broader concerns. To unify these paintings by intrinsic value of colour or shape is to miss the fact that it is their differences which gives significance. In the absence of a singular reading these paintings offer for consideration everything that exists outside of the artists experience and the resultant work. With their meaning not imbued in the paint surface but constituted somewhere within the realm of the respondent, these paintings represent something very important and being forgotten within culture, namely the broadest aspects of our imaginative experience. Not only the imaginative experience of someone culturally defined as an artist but of those responding to the work. These paintings require serious contemplation by the visitor to the exhibition, and when doing so maybe visitors should ask themselves the question ""What is meant by, 'what does it mean!'?""

The complacent and wholesale use of the female ""form"" as the subject mater within male dominated art practices has been taken to task. Women have struggled with the difficulty of finding ways to represent themselves. Some feminists have argued that any portrayal of womens' bodies will inevitably be subject to voyeurism and that it is necessary to adopt strategies whereby womens' experiences are discussed in the absence of actual representations of the body. Other feminists have argued that it is feasible to portray the female body and that it can be celebrated through ""positive"" representations. This series of talks aims to explore and discuss the relationship between particular visual art practices and sexual politics. The Symposium will concentrate upon the particular issue of ""the representation ot the female body in art"". All four lectures and symposium are open and admission is free.

Each triptych is accompanied by a central panel of text.If regarded as 'documentary' photography then these works seem inadequate. However, it is not Palmer's intention to read them this way. His experience of South Africa was an experience of desolation and bleakness. Rather, the works have a resonance which stems from the relationship of the text to the pictures and which conveys, through cool and subtle nuances, the devastation of Palmer's personal encounter with that land.

The structures are built in steel, piece by, piece, sometimes using ""found"" materials and sometimes cutting pieces to shape. As the sculpture develops John changes and modifies the form until it satisfies him and seems ""right"" . Some areas are faintly textured and he sometimes adds colour to give mood and unity . The process is not important to him, it is the final piece which is important. His work is based on personal experience of life and of spaces. This does not mean that each piece is a direct comment on a particular experience nor would he wish to be specific about his feelings. The spectator is required to experience the spaces, to move through the sculpture imaginatively and to respond visually. Some of the spaces he creates are open and some are closed off with tiny openings so that one can enter imaginatively. Looking carefully at the seemingly open forms one notices that an apparent doorway is blocked off visually by a bar, or that a step inhibits stepping by a sharp edge. He uses architectural references which are sometimes cancelled by sculptural references or can transpose into human references.

Canvass I and II will bring together an intriguing range of painting practices. Canvass, as the title suggests, is being staged in order to give support to and project the work of the ten painters. Canvass I and II have been jointly curated by John Hansard Gallery and Milton Keynes Exhibition Gallery, where the two shows will be exhibited in the early summer.",3346; 3347; 3348; 3349; 3350; 3351; 3352; 3353; 3354; 3355; 3356; 3357; 3358; 3359

This is the first attempt to present important but largely ignored aspects of British photography in a specific context: a revaluation of the medium in the light of current art practice. It reflects the shift in the use of photography from the semi-documentary approach of 1970's conceptualism to the interest in the possibilities of constructing a specifically photographic dialogue with the 1980's. The artists in the show belong to the ""second generation"" involved in a debate that began in the 1970's. They do not, however, represent a group or movement. They differ substantially in their use of style or use of the medium ; they have different aspirations and different strategies. They respond individually to the realities of the visually more aggressive (and aesthetically increasingly impoverished) nature of the contemporary world. Through different ways of manipulating photographic convention, they all search for a new autonomy for the photographic image. The exhibition was curated by Pavel Buchler and was originally shown at Cambridge Darkroom. The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with essays and photographs by the exhibiting artists.

Craft Matters is being organised by the John Hansard Gallery in collaboration with West Surrey College of Art & Design, with the financial assistance of Southern Arts Association, South East Arts Association and the generous support of the Crafts Council.The three selectors for this exhibition have brought together  an extraordinary range of objects; for example a spoon, a sculpture, a child's toy, West Indian steel drums, a wooden treble recorder, lengths of machine produced cloth and a hand-sewn quilt. The objects have been carefully chosen to draw attention to what each selector feels are the key issues in debates which are current in the craft world. What is it that defines a piece of craft as opposed to an art object? Does 'crafted' mean 'hand-made'? Does a craft object have to be for a specific use or function? Moreover, are the categories 'craft' and 'art' artificial and obstructive? Tanya Harrod has chosen objects with the conviction that although craftspeople and artists are involved in similar aesthetic and material decisions, craft and art are in fact separate spheres because of being rooted in their own particular traditions. Like Tanya Harrod, Christopher Reid is concerned to promote a more deeply understood commitment to the crafts. For him, craft objects have an intrinsic value which transcends any obvious usefulness; this comes about through the spirit in which they are made and the meanings they take on as symbols. Pennina Barnett, on the other hand, takes the view that the differentiations which are made between craft and art are artificial and strained. She is concerned that the so-called 'decorative sex' is associated with the 'decorative arts' and she points out that the lesser status which has been accorded to the crafts has had a prejudicial effect on women involved in creative practices.",3366; 3367; 3368; 3369; 3370; 3371; 3372; 3373; 3374; 3375; 3376; 3377; 3378; 3379; 3380; 3381; 3382; 3383; 3384; 3385; 3386; 3387; 3388; 3389; 3390; 3391; 3392; 3393; 3394; 3395; 3396; 3397; 3398; 3399; 3400; 3401; 3402; 3403; 3404; 3405; 3406; 3407; 3408; 3409; 3410; 3411; 3412; 3413; 3414; 3415; 3416; 3417; 3418; 3419; 3420; 3421; 3422; 3423; 3424; 3425; 3426; 3427; 3428; 3429; 3430; 3431; 3432; 3433; 3434

Within this short life-span he released remarkable energies as a painter. His friends describe him in adult life as genial, impulsive, dedicated to painting. Only now, with the return to popularity of Victorian art, are his works emerging or being cleaned to meet the light of day. He was clearly prolific, and precise lines have yet to be drawn round his production; the present exhibition is intended as an exploratory one, to draw attention to undoubted works, point to possible others and, it is hoped, bring into the open more works by the artist which must survive, particularly in this area of Hampshire where he lived and painted.",3599; 3600; 3601; 3602

Until 1964 he showed at the Rowan Gallery but after that, due to a total dissatisfaction with everything he did, stopped exhibiting until 1980. During this period of total reconstruction of both thought and practice he developed a lasting interest in Art Theory and became very involved with the problems of teaching Art. He taught alongside Harry Thubron at Lancaster, Leicester and the Royal College before being appointed principal of the School of Art at Goldsmith's College, a post he held for ten years. He resigned from this position in 1980 in order, once again, to concentrate upon his own work.Subsequently, the work has focused on an exploration of the implicit relationships between words and images. Alfred Jarry and Marcel Duchamp have been his two main influences along with recent theorists such as Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze and Barthes. Since 1980 he has concentrated in one way or another on questions of the artist's ""identity"" and ""authority"", in other words, upon the question of ""authorship""The installation Singular Cruelties (1980-81) sought to juxtapose two notions of authorship, namely, that implicit in modernism -'divine authority'- with the more 'reflexive' version of authorship found in modern criticism. The installations He Thought He Saw And Rattlesnake (1982) and Before Depiction (1984) sought to show how self consciousness in authorship always involves a meditation upon the nature of ""language"" and of ""mind"". In this new work he has taken this same issue and tried to explore its relationship to the ""construction of history"", on the one hand, and the construction of ""myths of identity"" on the other.",3603; 3604; 3605

These recent paintings are the result of a visit to the Scottish Highlands where he made drawings and took numerous photographs. The drawings and photographs are never populated but concentrate on particularities and details of the landscape rather than vistas or views. A ""pile"" of photographs form the foundation of McKeever's paintings. Having sifted through these photographs, particular shots or details are blown up and fixed onto the stretched canvas, It is on this surface that he paints. Through the combination of painted abstract forms and representational photographic forms, McKeever explores a wide and subtle variety of moods.

Each photograph combines a portrait of the person with pictures of objects, images and abstract forms in order to give a more distinct characterisation of the subject. Auberger says that ""the 12 photographic compositions border upon the traditional subject matter of photography as well as on painterly imagination"". David Gallant's photographs are a personal means of expressing his visual appreciation of ""life moments that meant everything"". Of a sequence featuring hands, he says that it ""was very much a ' one-off' personal project and came about because of my fascination over what a human hand could not only do, but say. The strong graphic approach was part of my working method, and is in no way contrived , although very much preconceived"". On Sunday, 5 February 1984, Tom Evans invited a number of people to ""come to a party and have your photograph taken"". The party took place on the first floor of the house and guests were invited downstairs, individually or in groups, to be photographed in formal conditions in the studio. ""Portrait Party"" addresses a number of concerns, namely: ""How to make portraits which both express individual character and are interesting pictures; how to relate individuals to family groups i how to produce a body of work that is both a set of individually valid pictures and a composite portrait of the event: and how to concentrate a huge body of picture making into one day's session"".",3736; 3737; 3738

1983_11_REBECCA_HORN,1983,15/11/1983,23/12/1983,Rebecca Horn,Rebecca Horn,1015,"The exhibition at the John Hansard Gallery will be the first time that her work has been seen in Great Britain. Since 1970 her work has included (and on occasions) combined performances, objects, ""kinetic"" installations, photographs, video, films, drawings and texts. In her early work Rebecca Horn was concerned with the body and how feelings and gestures could be extended by means of constructed devices attached to parts of the body such as the head, shoulders and the hands, which expanded the territory of the human machine. Some of her work from this period can be seen on video at the gallery during the exhibition. The idea of extending and covering the body continued to develop in Rebecca Horn's work when she introduced bird feathers as a ""second skin"" in the works ""Feather instrument"", 1972 and ""Cockfeather mask"", 1974. Bird feathers introduced a deliberate highly symbolic element into her work which she describes in the following statement : ""The bird dies, the feathers live on - just like hair. Feathers can last for centuries like the fetishes of the Shamans in South America, Oceania or Asia... The feather covering is a layer for protection and warmth and also becomes in my objects a second body space that surrounds the person and hides parts of the body. With these wings, that are fastened to the body, the Performer can wrap himself up, open them out, only to enclose himself again in the protective interior.""The use of feathers, either directly or translated into mechanical objects have continued to be a major symbol in Rebecca Horn' s work. Objects in the exhibition such as ""Small Feather Wheel, "" and ""Hanging Fan"" 1982 are part of this continuous ""story "". Rebecca Horn's videos and films have always interrelated with her objects, some of which have featured prominently in her films. In her two most recent films ""Der Eintanzer"" 1978 (l6mm 45 mins) and ""La Ferdinanda"" 1981 (35mm 90 mins) Rebecca Horn has used film as an autonomous medium where her objects and the performance of actors becomes an integrated whole. On November 14 at 6. 30pm the film ""Der Entanzer"" (""The. Dancing Cavalier"") will be shown in the main lecture theatre of the Murray Building adjacent to the John Hansard Gallery.This exhibition was made in collaboration with the Kunsthaus  Zurich and the Serpentine Gallery, London.

The exhibition includes working samples, drawings and cartoons as well as the tapestries themselves. Selected by Ann Sutton.The John Hansard Gallery has invited Ann Sutton, the well known writer and weaver, to select an exhibition of traditional woven tapestry. The exhibition will show approaches to tapestry weaving by means of examples, working samples, drawings and cartoons . It is also intended to include photographic records of the weaving of well-known tapestries and a video of a major tapestry workshop. If possible, live demonstrations of tapestry weaving will be organised in conjunction with the exhibition. The exhibition will comprise three sections: 1. Spontaneous tapestry in which the weaver works directly into the warp without using a drawn image, as a guide. Most of the work to be included in this section is by children aged between 8 and 16 working in the Harrania workshop and the Atelier des Pyramides, Egypt. Their tapestries depict family and village scenes. 2. Direct tapestry in which a pre-conceived image is developed throughout the weaving process, often involving a highly imaginative use of materials. It is hoped to include the work of several leading contemporary artists in this section. Source material for their tapestries will be included. 3. Tapestries produced by major workshops. This section will focus on the way in which workshops go about weaving tapestries designed by artists who usually work in another medium. Such artists include Elizabeth Blackadder, Howard Hodgkin , Henry Moore and Edouardo Paolozzi . Some artists are encouraged to design specifically for tapestry technique and work in conjunction with the weavers. Other artists' designs are skilfully ""translated"" from an original drawing or painting into tapestry by the workshops .

This interest in new painting has been marked by several major exhibitions in Europe culminating with the exhibition Zeitgeist in Berlin. Work by young painters from France, Germany and Italy is making its mark internationally. Although there have been recent developments in British sculpture and photography, new British painting has either been neglected or is non-existent. Not being convinced that there was no sign of a new generation, I took it upon myself to keep one eye open on the work being produced by painters within the southern region. There was no particular reason or idea why I should concentrate on the south, only that being based at the John Hansard Gallery, it was convenient to visit studios within an easy driving distance. The point being that this exhibition is not aimed at showing what is happening in the region, nor is it an exhibition of local artists. It is more a reflection of an interest in the possibility of there being developments in British painting. The five painters in this exhibition have one thing in common which is nothing to do with their geographical proximity. It is that the content of their painting is largely concerned with the depiction of their own mythologies. This relates much of what they are doing to some of the young European painters, and not to the British tradition of the sixties formalist painters which has predominated our art schools for so long. The exhibition does not try to come to any conclusions about the artists' work at this stage, but simply through the paintings and some brief statements to give these five painters the opportunity to contribute to what might be happening in British painting.

1982_12_FIGUREHEADS_FROM,1982,14/12/1982,22/01/1983,Figureheads From The Cutty Sark Collection,Norman Gaches; Jack Whitehead; Anon.,29; 1444; 1445,"Even when isolated from the ships they once adorned, figureheads remain symbols that evoke a bygone age. The tradition of figurehead carving goes back to the earliest days of navigation, and its continuation can be seen today in the restoration work being done by two woodcarvers, Jack Whitehead and Norman Gaches, on show at the John Hansard Gallery from 14 December, 1982 - 22 January, 1983, in an exhibition loaned by the Cutty Sark Society. The figureheads come from the John Silver Collection of figureheads and marine objects formed over a period of years by John Sidney Cumbers, himself known as ""John Silver"". After his death, his widow presented the collection to the Cutty Sark Society in order that it might be displayed to the public on the Clipper Ship, the Cutty Sark at Greenwich. The figureheads being shown at the John Hansard Gallery are probably all nineteenth-century. Little is known about their provenance. Many figureheads in the collection are in need of restoration, and are being restored by Jack Whitehead and Norman Gaches. There are various stages involved in restoring figureheads. First of all, the restorers remove many layers of hard paint from the figureheads, often revealing delicate, hidden carving. Any interior rot is then arrested by means of a special resin and new wood is glued in place where parts of the figure are missing. This is then carved to match the original. Finally the figurehead is repainted and guilded, using priming coat, undercoat and finishing colours. The exhibition at the John Hansard Gallery provides an excellent opportunity to see figureheads in all the stages of their restoration. It includes some whose restoration is complete and others still in a dilapidated state. Tools used in the restoration work will also be displayed.Jack Whitehead and Norman Gaches, who live and work on the Isle of Wight, specialise in carving and restoring figureheads for ships. They have been largely responsible for reviving the custom of decorating ships with carvings and their work can be seen in many parts of the world. Many well known ships carry their figureheads, including the sea training ships, Sir Winston Churchill and the Malcolm Miller, the Sea Cadets Brig, the Royalist, and the Captain Scott (now the Youth of Oman). Their latest and largest project is the carving of a replica of the fifteen foot figure of a warrior with plumed helmet, sword and shield, for the first ironclad battleship built for the British Navy, HMS Warrior. The ship is currently being restored by the Maritime Trust. A photographic record of the carving of these and other figureheads will also be included in the exhibition.",4868; 4869; 4870
1982_11_PAINTER_AS,1982,07/11/1982,04/12/1982,Painter as Photographer,Various Artists,560,"The Arts Council touring exhibition, Painter as Photographer, which opens in Southampton on November 3, presents 200 photographs by major 19th and 20th century painters. The photographs were either taken by the painters or to their specifications. Among the artists represented are Delacroix, Degas, Bonnard, Vuillard, Munch, Schiele, Magritte, Warhol and Hockney. In most cases it is the first time that their photographs have been exhibited in this country. With the photographs there is a documentary section on the artists' paintings. The exhibition has been selected by Marina Vaizey, art critic of the Sunday Times, and it coincides with the publication of her book, Artist as Photographer, published by Sidgwick and Jackson. The photographs are impressive in their own right, but they also throw fascinating light on these artists' work as painters. Delacroix, for example, welcomed the invention of photography as a useful tool for artists. The American painter, Thomas Eakins, photographed his students dressed in classical costumes or posed in the nude to help compose his paintings. Others, including Degas, photographed family and friends. Drawing on the same subject as their paintings, the photographs of Vuillard and Bonnard are readily identifiable. Magritte, however, posed his friends to look like his paintings - the real turned into the surreal. Munch, Kirchner and Schiele all took revealing photographs of themselves which are interesting to compare with their self-portrait paintings. Today, Hockney and Warhol photograph their own lives as well as using photographs for their painting.",4867

As the title of the exhibition suggests, she conceives of these drawings as having an imaginative narrative quality, similar to that of fairy stories. Her drawings, many of which verge towards graffiti, evolve as she works. In addition to Shelagh Wakely's drawings, the John Hansard Gallery will be showing prints and sculptures by the artist. Shelagh Wakely was originally trained as a scientist, and researched into grassland agronomy. She turned to art in 1958, and taught in Ghana and Pakistan.

The exhibition focuses on the work of ten young British photographers. Theirs is some of the most imaginative and thought provoking photographic work being produced in Britain today. One characteristic shared by these photographers is that their work challenges traditional photographic conventions. The kind of formal strategies they employ include the use of text, flash, colour, the creation of pieces which contain several photographs and a particular use of the human figure. It is precisely these strategies which are emphasised in this exhibition.",4775; 4776; 4777; 4778; 4779; 4780; 4781; 4782; 4783; 4784; 4785; 4786; 4787; 4788; 4789; 4790; 4791; 4792; 4793; 4794; 4795; 4796; 4797; 4798; 4799; 4800; 4801; 4802; 4803; 4804; 4805; 4806; 4807; 4808; 4809; 4810; 4811; 4812; 4813; 4814; 4815; 4816; 4817; 4818; 4819; 4820; 4821; 4822; 4823; 4824; 4825; 4826; 4827; 4828; 4829; 4830; 4831; 4832; 4833; 4834; 4835; 4836; 4837; 4838; 4839; 4840; 4841; 4842

Whereas previous exhibitions of Smith' s work have drawn on his varied interests, sculpture and illustrations, for instance, this exhibition focuses specifically on his painting. Twenty large paintings are being shown, which were conceived as a group and made specifically for this exhibition. They are concerned with the artist's own retrospective view of his childhood spent in the 1950s in Southend-on-Sea. They are characterized by images that evoke recollections of the childhood - the atmosphere of the ""Golden Mile"" at night with its brightly coloured lights, and the optimism of the post-War period epitomized in books like the ""Boys Wonder"" series. It was from these childhood books that the themes of the paintings derive - Transport, Pets and Science. Smith has called this group of new paintings ""synthetic"", a term which not only refers to his use of plastic paint, but to the idea of bringing together, or synthesizing, a wide range of source material - both common place and peculiar to art.

An important influence on new directions in sculpture in the late sixties and seventies, he has now an international reputation. Yet he is also a prolific maker of etchings and linocuts and these, together with his drawing, the majority having been tucked away in sketchbooks and portfolios, have seldom been surveyed. His treatment of traditional subjects, such as landscape, portraiture and animal drawings is often unorthodox. Landscapes of Scotland , Tuscany, and North Wales utilise a shorthand of brief strokes, a treatment which is unsentimental, minimizes incidental features, but which nevertheless captures afresh the essence of the places he visits. Born in 1941 along the North Wales coast at Prestatyn, Flanagan studied at St Martin's School of Art and now lives in London. The British Pavilion at the 1982 Venice Biennale will be devoted to his work.

1981_12_BILL_BRANDT,1981,07/12/1981,09/01/1982,Bill Brandt: A Retrospective Exhibition,Bill Brandt,1456,"Bill Brandt was born in London in 1905. At the age of 24 he went to Paris to work as an assistant to Man Ray, an artist and photographer closely associated with Surrealism. Surrealism had a deep and lasting influence on Brandt's work. One of his earliest photographs, The Flea Market, Paris;1930, was published in the Surrealist Magazine, Minotaure, and in the late 1940s he recalled how a street which he had photographed in Bayswater reminded him of a de Chirico painting. Even the theme of nudes on a rocky shore, which he took up in the late 1950s has Surrealist connotations. However that ""sense of mystery"" derived from Surrealism does not characterise all Brandt's work. Many of his photographs reveal what one of his friends described as a ""sense of justice and social contrast"". This is most apparent in his documentary photographs.The exhibition was selected by Valerie Lloyd of the Royal Photographic Society and David Mellor, who is a lecturer in the School of English and American Studies at the University of Sussex.

(...)Three important principles emerged. Art and the Sea was to encourage the creation of new work, it was to raise money for artists to complete this work, and it was to mount a series of different exhibitions around the coast based on the common theme of the sea, allowing local influences and individual problems of space to mould and contain each exhibition within the particular dimensions of each gallery. The Committee felt strongly that the involvement required of each gallery in selecting its own version of the Art and the Sea exhibition was particularly important and preferable to transporting the same exhibition from venue to venue. Artists were then invited, through a series of advertisements in the national and art press to submit for selection either current work relating to the sea, or proposals for new work on the same theme. Over half the 650 entries submitted were in the form of proposals for new work, requiring, of course, differing sums of money to complete. The method of selection involved the Directors of the participating galleries being invited to select their individual exhibitions from this overall submission. As a result of the large response, two periods of selection were required. Although the selectors were together for each session, they selected independently and, in fact, each gallery selected quite different exhibitions for their particular space.Selector for the exhibition at the John Hansard Gallery, Southampton: Barry BarkerArt and the Sea is set up primarily to promote and sponsor current and new work based around the theme of the sea. The exhibition Art And The Sea will be seen at nine U.K. galleries and arts centres during 1981 (culminating at the I.C.A. London, in January 1982). Each gallery has selected a different exhibition from a central submission of work, thus emphasising regional influences and the nature of the gallery space, as well as reflecting the personal choice of the selector.Art and The Sea gratefully acknowledges financial support from the Arts Council of Great Britain, The English Tourist Board, Marks and Spencer Ltd, and P&O Cruisers.

During the past three years the department has used photography with a number of inner London secondary schools on projects of varying duration. In general the project has been concerned with the following : Integrating work across the curriculum Relating pupils out of school experience to work in school. Generating exploratory or critical work in relation to reading texts. Introducing practical expressive work into an area of study. Thematic or topic based project work. The department has been particularly interested in developing schemes of work where practical photography is used in relation to other modes of study to examine and express pupils experience of contemporary culture. We are currently engaged in structuring the resulting body of work to show more clearly the different approaches of the SPP. At this point work done by both in -school and out of school groups, which is directly concerned with pupils culture, is being organised to form a Cockpit Gallery Touring exhibition.",5455

The main emphasis of exhibitions in the Gallery will be on contemporary work, but as the Gallery is part of a University tradition it will also take note ofthe past and of other disciplines. In the light of this, the theme of 'The Panoramic Image' seemed to offer an extremely suitable subject for an opening exhibition. It allowed various visual media to be presented; it was a phenomenon which had historical as well as contemporary applications; it could work at a number of different levels. In short, it encapsulated much of the essence of the new Gallery. By its very nature the subject matter of 'The Panoramic Image' was difficult to handle physically and academically. However, it constituted an exciting challenge which was accepted. The resultant exhibition has brought together a large collection of work, but it should not be viewed in any way as an attempt to provide a definitive statement on the subject. It merely offers a starting point for further research and interest and indicates ways in which some artists and photographers have used the idea of the panorama during the past few hundred years. The work in the exhibition is supplemented by essays written for the catalogue by individual members of the team commissioned by the Gallery to put together the exhibition. Dr. John Sweetman, Senior Lecturer in the History of Art and Fine Art at the University of Southampton dealt with the history of the panorama until mid nineteenth century. Jonathan Bayer, an American photographer resident in London, researched the use of the panoramic concept in photography and Dr. Brandon Taylor, art historian and ex-principal of Winchester School of Art, explored how modern artists had experimented with the panoramic image. All three contributors were noble in their efforts on behalf of the project. Special thanks are also due to Francis Pugh who came in at a critical late stage to co-ordinate the exhibition and under whose wise guidance it finally took shape. As far as the catalogue itself is concerned BAS Printers Ltd. and Eric Molden, the designer, took the project to heart and together with James Fraser of Zwemmer Ltd. ensured that the efforts of all concerned with the exhibition would be complemented expertly and sympathetically in print. The most warming feature of the whole exercise, however, has been the extraordinary goodwill, generosity, patience and trust of many individuals and institutions who have lent work to a gallery which to most of them is entirely unknown. They are all listed elsewhere in the catalogue, but I should like to take this opportunity of expressing the deep gratitude of the Gallery for their help. The evolution of the John Hansard Gallery was a considerable act of faith by the University of Southampton. It is to be hoped that 'The Panoramic Image' exhibition will justify the confidence shown in the concept of the Gallery by both the University and other benefactors. Leo Stable.",5075; 5076; 5077; 5078; 5079; 5080; 5081; 5082; 5083; 5084; 5085; 5086; 5087; 5088; 5089; 5090; 5091; 5092; 5093; 5094; 5095; 5096; 5097; 5098; 5099; 5100; 5101; 5102; 5103; 5104; 5105; 5106; 5107; 5108; 5109; 5110; 5111; 5112; 5113; 5114; 5115; 5116
1981_3_UP/DOWN,1981,13/03/1981,11/04/1981,"Martin Roberts: Up/Down, Charm/Strangeness",Martin Roberts,1515,"Up/Down; Charm/Strangeness is about cities, and most particularly about those parts of city landscape which are 'going on quietly around us', and which we tend to absorb in a subliminal fashion. It is also concerned with the visually 'schizophrenic' nature of contemporary urban scenery. Wurst Max's ethnic German hot-dog stall, photographed in London, literally inches away from a poster fora blue film telling us that German men prefer pubescent girls, is an example of such schizophrenic juxtaposition. In this exhibition, landscape emerges as the major interest, given that landscape both mirrors a quality of life while also shaping it. People are absent from the photographs, but only literally. Photographs from Germany and other countries appear alongside those made in England - it was important to the photographer to break down cultural identities - working towards 'elements within landscapes' rather than an identification of particular places and specific times. The sense of alienation so created is important. The photographs were intended as a series of relationships, working within the picture and within the series rather than being identifying marks representing particular objects. Rather than being topographical indications, the photographs are abstract pieces, intending to convey certain almost literary ideas, including the progression through dreams, the inhabitation of a stage set and a romanticist's approach to a set of physical facts. Looking at these photographs, the viewer who is in a habit of making photographic role judgments - this is documentary, this is landscape and that's a portrait - is forced to reconsider preconceptions. These photographs operate on several different levels and are partly focussed, one might suspect, on the photographer's own preoccupation with himself as an isolated and uninvolved participant; we/he are distanced by the 'foreigness' of each chosen situation. The choice of title comes from the 'New Physics' and the discovery of sub-atomic 'quark' particles to which physicists gave names such as 'up' and 'down'. Other particles were said to be 'charmed' or to possess the quality of 'strangeness'. Martin Roberts adapted the words for the exhibition because they express some of the 'elements' in his landscapes. Martin Roberts was born in Brighton in 1950, and was a student at Derby College of Art from 1969 to 1972. Since leaving Derby, he has lived in the North West and has received two major grants from the Arts Council. This is his third one-man exhibition and he is currently completing a 30 minute narrative film.

His daily routine took him into the homes of hundreds of families and into contact with the social life of three suburban communities. It also brought him into contact with every type of civic, social and fraternal organisation in the area. He used this opportunity to document society around him and subsequently produced two books ""Suburbia"" and ""Our Kind of People"" from which the photographs in this exhibition are drawn. The book ""Suburbia"" has sold 400,000 copies throughout the world and Bill Owens fame has spread with it. He writes of it, 'The people I met enjoy the life-style of the suburbs. They have realized the ""American Dream"". They are proud to be home owners and to have achieved material success ... The photos ... express the lives of the people I know. The comments on each photograph are what the people feel about themselves'. The Gallery is bringing Bill Owens across to England on a lecture tour during March and he will be in Southampton talking about his work at 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24th March, in the Murray Building Lecture Theatre, across the car park at the rear of the Gallery.

He is now Chairman of the New School of Photography in New York, which is one of the liveliest and most influential schools of photography in America. He is a catalytic figure in American East Coast photography and is still very active taking photographs himself. His work, however, has never been shown in this country and the Gallery decided it was time he and his work were introduced here. He was born end bred in New York and is a considerable personality who passionately believes in freedom of speech. He became famous by photographing this aspect of society in America. He worked for the New York Times & Life magazine and produced a hook on the subject. He is a man of many interests but the dissent photographs give a key to his character. They are very strong powerful statements and now represent a valuable document on American life in the 60's. Fernandez is a very lively and stimulating speaker and so the Gallery has brought him across from America to lecture on his work during the exhibition. The lecture takes place at 7.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 20th January, in the Murray Lecture Theatre in Salisbury Road off University Road.

The earliest works are the three wall drawings,one of which ""Finished Beer"" was first shown in Bari, Italy in 1978. The complete set of five wall drawings were shown in the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in January 1980. In preparing for this exhibition Tremlett has taken into consideration the particular qualities of the gallery, by using the screens on which the wall drawings are made like large sheets of paper. The works in the exhibition all have a connection with the countries and places where Tremlett has travelled, which in this case divide into the hot and cold climates of Canada, Alaska and Africa. Although on close inspection of many of the drawings it is possible to see a place name noted, it is the title of the work that is more important. The images Tremlett draws are always the first impression images. Often they are the most obvious and striking images from the places visited (e.g. Shillelagh, Shield, Canoe). In works such as the poems and the drawings ""Bar Talk"" and ""Salmon Fishing"" reference to situations when travelling are made but are not made specific, as in all of Tremlett's work, he likes to leave things open ended and remain at a distance.",5289; 5290; 5291; 5292; 5293; 5294

It is a touring exhibition, and the John Hansard Gallery is its first stop in Britain, having shown in various galleries in Germany prior to coming here. If there is a theme (apart from the place of origin) running through the show, it is a sense of expansiveness, attempting to bridge the gap between self and environment. We see, particularly in the paintings, various records of the mutual adjustment of ideation and its means to physical. form. Shifting its ground, fixing elements as perceptual possibilities present themselves, the works testify to processes of exploration and decision across the field where image and feeling meet. This is a move away from the genre of social critique predominant in Berlin in the 60s and early 70s. These new works - many of the pieces executed this year - could be seen as representative of a new generation of artistic values in West Berlin's unique cultural situation, shifting the Subjective ground to a more personal, individualized basis.The exhibition opens on the occasion of Herr Willy Brandt's visit to deliver the Fawley Lecture at the University.

1980_9_DRAWINGS,1980,22/09/1980,18/10/1980,Alan Johnston: Drawings,Alan Johnston,1311,"From a distance, and in photographs, Johnston's drawings are distinguishable as little more than hazy grey shapes - sometimes club-like, more often rectangular, always vertical - commanding the middle-ground of white panels of paper. They are framed as individual 'pictures' and spaced, in accordance with their collective title, as an overall composition, both with regard to each other and the room itself: the intervals of the hanging relate to the common, though variously employed, measure of the drawings themselves. And a similar attention to detail, though by contrast of a totally unmechanical kind, becomes more and more apparent the closer you look. What is amorphous at a few feet turns into a myriad of marks at a few inches, as busily various, as subject to channels and shoals as the course of a river indeed, though analogous, rather than representative, of the physical experience of flowing water. Each drawing is completed, as their energy suggests, without interruption, the sessions sometimes lasting as long as twelve hours. Johnston is a Scot and this methodology of growth consciously places his work in the organic tradition of Celtic art - it is no surprise to find that he is also a keen Joycean. But culture is not art, and the work must stand on its own merits. This it does. Its drawing is both novel and exquisitely delicate, exhibiting that unfailing characteristic of true art, and infinite capacity for taking pains. The paper is especially hard and shows no indentation, and the pencil, a German Staedtler 3mm, one of the few leads so far invented that could sustain this kind of wear. Normal brand pencils would have been consumed by these drawings a box at a time, and been in the process a quite impracticable source of interruption. Concentration is absolutely essential to the work. It enables the artist's hand to trace the emotional pattern of his thought. John McEwen.
