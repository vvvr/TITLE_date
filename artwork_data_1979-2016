A self-playing pianola sits beneath a snow machine. Snow falls gently and the pianola ��� for a moment ��� comes alive, playing a composition (the artist�۪s own) somewhere between chaos and order. On top of the instrument sits a toy monkey, a symbol of mischief or trickery. The pianola was a staple of the silent film era, but is still used in theatre productions to this day. Hybridised by the artist, here it forms a quietly melancholic centrepiece, prone to frenetic interruptions. A 16mm film projector intermittently casts a nostalgic, cinematic light against the wall behind, which is coated in luminous paint. As the projection dies, a roving light dimly illuminates the wall, memorylike. Commissioned by Dundee Contemporary Arts.",2012_6_TORSTEN_LAUSCHMANN,Torsten Lauschmann

As if under the restless lens of a telescope or magnifying glass, each tiny glimmer reveals itself as one of a series of a numbers, floating in the void of space. Conjured up through a specially written ���flocking algorithm�۪ on an everyday gaming computer, the piece alludes to complex mathematical systems. Yet, at the heart of this gentle snowstorm of chaos, Lauschmann also paints a humorous picture of God the creator looking out over the universe, yet seemingly unable to give his attention to more than a few of his subjects at any given time.

Taking the notion of Luddite Frame Breakers ��� 19th century English protestors against industrialisation ��� the artist constructed a musical device in which twelve players performed beneath a light.

In 1988, Smith began to work with a standard sheet size of commercial printing paper, which he has used consistently since then. Likening the drawing process to ���installing something on paper�۪, Smith gleans ideas from day to day observations of objects and surfaces. Firstly cutting lines into the paper, he then applies a layer of oil paint which is later cleaned, revealing areas where pigment has seeped into the rag.

The completed benches, a number of which are on show, are constructed from glued, folded paper, via an extraordinary sequence of ���manufacturing�۝ processes (staining, crushing, folding, glueing, moulding etc.), all devised and made by the artist.

If we succumb to anthropomorphism, we might imagine that the concrete form is attempting to swallow itself, or to consume its reflection. One might also imagine that a sculpture on this scale would imply immobility and permanence, but here the concrete form and sheet of Perspex are supported by wheeled elements resembling industrial racks.

For example, for her exhibition Ingenium in Rennes (2010), she presented objects she had cast together with their moulds. With this more recent series of works, Effet Cocktail, her working process is less easily discernible. To begin this project, the artist first emptied her studio entirely. Inspired by images relating to brain function and creativity, she started making works in the space, ranging from sculptural elements to wall drawings, treating the entire studio as a blank canvas. The materials that she employed included powdery and viscous substances that would leave traces of the making process. Lain̩ then invited the photographer Andr̩ Morin to photograph the work. Used to documenting finished works installed in museums and galleries, he was here asked to capture an entire working process. When we look at these photographs, are we seeing an image of her work, taken by someone else, or is the image itself the work? Can a sculptural installation comprise solely photographs?

However, her keen sense of humour and the work�۪s understated absurdity prevent it from falling into mere pastiche. In About The Good and The Bad Sculpture, Houben explores questions such as how to make a visual decision, or why certain things ���work�۝ in sculpture.

As Caoimhin Mac Giolla Leith wrote in his recent catalogue essay on her work: ���In spite of Ekblad�۪s instinctive command of persuasive sculptural form, much of the work resembles the mashedup residue of a decidedly slapdash archaeological dig focused on the very recent past.�۝ Ekblad collects material ��� both physical and metaphorical ��� on her ���drifts�۝, as she terms them, as she explores a city or travels the world. The works included within Manufacture 2 feature a dramatic installation of stained black fabric, the result of a dance that the artist performed by repeatedly rolled a shopping trolley through bleach and then across the surface of the fabric. Also exhibited is an accompanying poem that evokes this action, and three floor-based sculptures in which found objects of interest are sunk into fast-setting concrete. In a recent interview, the artist stated the following: ���The metal materials I rack from the state-owned trash yard and bend and wield into sculptures��_ [are] no longer part of the mineral kingdom, nor are they considered usable tools or utensils. They are rejected because there was a new fashion, or they had become too bent, too destroyed, too mashed.�۝",2011_9_MANUFACTURE,Manufacture 2

1916,594,Jane and Louise Wilson,Oddments Room Iv (A Canoe Voyage Up The Minnay Sotor),2008,"C-Type prints on aluminium and Diasec. Two earlier photographic works from a series entitled The Oddments Room are presented alongside the works made in Chernobyl. Shot in an antiquarian bookshop in London which functions as a book ���hospital�۪ for incomplete first and second edition books, these works again create a link with the historical past. Books are stacked claustrophobically, floor to ceiling, categorised by subject. Faulty, dysfunctional or ruined, yet still of great value, whilst they lie in waiting there is an assumption that someday they will be cared for, unlike those in Pripyat. The yardstick against the shelf of Oddments Room IV (A Canoe Voyage up the Minnay Sotor) acts a measure of space and scale, and suggests too a measure of time. In the accompanying photograph Oddments Room V (Atlas), the yardstick is replaced by a lone female figure in ���40s black and white checked dress, standing in the doorway with her back to the viewer, as though on the threshold between past and present. The figure is Louise Wilson, the only entire human figure depicted within the exhibition.",2011_7_JANE_AND,Jane and Louise Wilson

1918,594,Jane and Louise Wilson,Atomgrad (Nature Abhors A Vacuum),2010,"Eight C-Type prints on aluminium and Diasec. Shortly after the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant on 26 April 1986, 135,000 people were evacuated from an area extending thirty kilometres around the damaged reactor. Within this Zone was the city of Pripyat, built in 1970 to house the employees of the nuclear power plant and their families. Pripyat, known as The Atomic City, was the ninth nuclear city (atomograd) in the former Soviet Union and considered one of its finest places to live. There were all the amenities of a modern Soviet city, with schools, shops, hospital, recreational and cultural facilities. At the time of the accident Pripyat had a population of 45,000 people. It is now uninhabitable and will never be lived in again. Atomgrad (Nature Abhors a Vacuum), 2010 is a body of eight photographic prints depicting interior spaces within Pripyat�۪s abandoned buildings. Books remain on shelves and desks, bed frames remain intact and onceexquisite parquet flooring lies on the ground like rubble. In these images, history has been preserved as if in a vacuum; yet, over time, vegetation and wildlife have flourished, encroaching upon this man-made environment in remarkable ways, despite the toxicity of the radioactivitythat still persists. A yardstick appears within each image and is a recurring motif throughout the exhibition. These objects ��� functional yet obsolete ��� allude to the act of measurement, not only in terms of scale but also radioactivity. They are a reminder of the artists�۪ role as documenters ��� comprehenders ��� of space.",2011_7_JANE_AND,Jane and Louise Wilson
1919,594,Jane and Louise Wilson,Altogether,2010,"Wood. This large sculpture is constructed from multiple yardsticks. The yardsticks, interlinked within a larger structure, are abstracted from their original function and suggest a questioning of the nature and limits of measurement. This imposing yet fragile construction is architectural, almost room-like, but unseated and unstable, echoing the spaces within the photographs. The work also draws art-historical parallels with the 1920s ���Spatial Constructions�۪ of Russian artist Alexandr Rodchenko, one of Russia�۪s most influential avant-garde artists. Rodchenko�۪s utopian ambitions for role of the artist as ���constructor�۪ of modern society form a highly ambivalent subtext to this work.",2011_7_JANE_AND,Jane and Louise Wilson
1920,594,Jane and Louise Wilson,Measure Obsolescere 2,2010,"Wood. Three further yardstick sculptures are mounted along the wall and floor of Gallery Two. These mirror the placement of yardsticks within the images of Atomgrad whilst demarcating the architectural space of the gallery. In punctuating the exhibition in this way, the yardsticks act as a register of scale between three-dimensional and photographic space.",2011_7_JANE_AND,Jane and Louise Wilson
1921,594,Jane and Louise Wilson,Face Scripting: What Did The Building See?,2011,"Three C-Type prints on aluminium and Diasec. These three photographic portraits present images of both artists, side by side. Photographed using infra-red, their faces appear scrubbed bare, yet are daubed with black and white markings reminiscent of those found on the yardsticks. This use of dazzle camouflage, in the form of face painting, is known to scramble face recognition software, widely used in digital surveillance photography as well as in more prosaic social media spaces. The role of the yardsticks is emphasised here as the artists�۪ faces multiply, print-by-print, suggesting units, readings or a counter. Whilst the other works in this exhibition incorporate these rulers as a ���forensic�۪ tool, calling to mind human involvement in an otherwise empty scene, Face Scripting takes a more self-conscious approach; what is our role as viewers of the Chernobyl site? Are we complicit in the activity of ���dark tourism�۪?",2011_7_JANE_AND,Jane and Louise Wilson

Saphir forms an earlier companion piece to MiddleSea and again features a maritime setting ��� in this instance, the port of Algiers. Comprising an evocative juxtaposition of two film sequences, the work contains a ���germ of a narrative�۪ ��� two characters, a man and woman, wandering, waiting and looking. Saphir focuses upon the crumbling art deco grandeur of the 1930s Hotel Es Safir and views of the Tariq Ibn Ziyad ferry, which travels to and from Marseille. The work alludes to the desire for escape, belonging and to return, though is never explicitly political. Saphir instead represents an emotional ��� and strikingly visual ��� response to the city and its unique light, architecture and interior spaces.",2009_9_SEAFARING,Zineb Sedira: Seafaring
548,586,Zineb Sedira,Middlesea,2008,"Single screen projection shot on Super 16mm film (16:9) 16 minutes. MiddleSea is a mesmeric, filmed depiction of a sea voyage. The film traces the somnambulant movements of a lone male as he rambles the deserted corridors of a ship, crossing the Mediterranean between Marseilles and Algiers. Camera shots shift between the white decks, the immense horizon and the tiniest details, accumulating to form an almost dream-like, cyclical journey that exists out of time. MiddleSea also features an extraordinary soundscape, created in collaboration with artist Mikhail Karikis, which interweaves, distorts and intensifies sound recorded on location with instrumental snippets and sound collages.",2009_9_SEAFARING,Zineb Sedira: Seafaring

Seafaring showcases a new work, Remnants of a Scattered Vessel, commissioned by the John Hansard Gallery. Comprising fifteen photographic lightboxes of varying sizes, the work presents a fragmented, luminescent portrait of a ship�۪s carcass on the desolate Mauritanian coastline, where the desert meets the sea. This multitude of glowing images focuses upon the boat�۪s decayed, rusted surfaces and attains an almost hallucinatory presence within the darkened Gallery space. The boat�۪s rotted remains signify a deathly finality ��� not simply the death of a vessel, but the death of a journey. This is particularly significant given that the location, the harbour city of Nouadhibou, is today a perilous embarkation route for would-be migrants. This metropolis is also Mauritania�۪s economic capital and home to the world�۪s largest ship graveyard, which has become both a shipping hazard and an ecological threat. The lightboxes�۪ bulk and trailing power cables add a physical aspect to the work that makes visible the fragile ecology implied within the imagery ��� the sun�۪s sapping heat and the ocean�۪s potential to both nourish and destroy. Remnants of a Scattered Vessel forms part of a prolific body of recent photographic and film works by the artist exploring this unique location.",2009_9_SEAFARING,Zineb Sedira: Seafaring

534,122,David Ward,Uncontrolled Images 1-9,1989,"Series of photograms.  Here, photographic paper was exposed to light through an enlarger with no slide or negative. These were developed and only partially fixed, then left on the studio floor, allowing dust and chemical residue to take effect over several days. The resulting galaxy-like images further explore the theme of light, its material ���realisation�۪, and chance effect.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
535,122,David Ward,Flying In The Face,1991,"Comprises twelve mirrors, each engraved at approximately head height, with drawings derived from many different sources, including painting, astronomy and scientific imagery. The engraved lines float seemingly in space, between the plane of reflection and the space of the Gallery ��� a cut into light. From afar, the reflection of the gallery is fragmented within the curving series of mirrors, creating a space of disjointed angles and corners, interspersed by the viewers�۪ own image.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
536,122,David Ward,Slow Time,1992,"Two semi-circular glass sections. The black section is highly reflective, the white, a void, blank. In one, your image is returned, in the other, absorbed or denied. The black offers depth, space, an opening, selfrecognition, only for this to be negated within the adjacent semi-circle. Suggestive of a sundial, clock, or lunar cycle, these polar hemispheres allude to a cycle of eternal return.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
537,122,David Ward,Casting The Die (Rodin),1995,"7 Photographic prints. The seven prints that comprise Casting the Die (Rodin), 1995, were produced during a residency at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds. This series of photographic works depicts the bronze cast of Rodin�۪s The Age of Bronze, held in the collection of Leeds Museums and Galleries (Leeds Art Gallery). These images reveal the cast�۪s patinated surfaces, yet almost ethereal and otherworldly presence. The material traces of the photographic process ��� striations, ripples and streaks ��� echo textures found on the cast itself, which had been situated in the open air for many years. These marks are deliberately retained within the visible margins of the print, occupying not only the ���empty�۪ edges but also interrupting the space of the image itself.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
538,122,David Ward,Analysis Of Beauty,2008,"Filmed in King�۪s College Chapel, Cambridge, The Analysis of Beauty, 2008, features two sequences of footage. Projected one above the other, these examine ��� literally ��� the two aspects of the beautiful fan vaulted ceiling: above and below. The work is rich in juxtapositions: light and dark, the divine and earthly, craft and utility, grandiosity and the prosaic. In her essay within the Slow Time exhibition publication, Suzanne Cotter notes: ���Taking his cue from Hogarth�۪s 18th century artistic treatise, The Analysis of Beauty, Ward suggests we might move beyond our general amazement at the architectural brilliance of the Chapel ceiling, to get beneath its skin, literally, to know it better.�۝",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
539,122,David Ward,"Landscape, Portrait, Light 1 ��� 8",2007-2008,"A series of small-scale colour works, each comprising two paper sheets, densely filled with pure pastel pigment. Unlike many other works within the exhibition, the reflected, projected or exposed image plays no part here. Harmonious and alluringly yet blank and inscrutable, these velvety surfaces are, on one hand, purely abstract. Yet, the colours derive from pastel boxed sets intended for certain subjects, e.g. landscapes, portraits and light. An oblique reference to figurative representation, this adds a layer of ambiguity to these seemingly mute colour-fields.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
540,122,David Ward,Compositions,1980-2008,"four postcard compilations. Akin to visual poems, these are mounted left aligned, like lines of text. Acquired and collected over many years, these series of cards conjure visual relationships within a diverse variety of imagery. Linking the phenomena of light, movement and form, they reveal highly personal networks of meaning that have developed over Ward�۪s career.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time
541,122,David Ward,Filmwater,1995-2008,"Super 8 film (transfered to digital video). The projected work Filmwater, 1995 - 2008, is one of a series of Super 8 films (transfered here to digital video) Ward made of the Orinoco River in the Amazonas in 1995. Here, the moving river surface transcends its subject matter to become abstract, immaterial. In this particular film the surface of the water never breaks and, at times, the directional flow becomes almost indiscernable. The projection space has not been darkened, allowing Gallery light to dilute the image, increasing its diaphanous quality.",2009_11_SLOW_TIME,David Ward: Slow Time

The commodities that came out of the West Indies, Americas, India and the Spice Islands changed the course of history and shaped the destinies of many individuals.  The scramble for sugar, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, tea, cotton and spices meant that different worlds became inextricably linked forever. Among the celebrations of wealth that remain from this time are The Bluecoat hospital in Liverpool, built by Bryan Blundell with the help of other merchants involved in Liverpool�۪s thriving slave trade; The Georgian house in Bristol built and owned by John Pinney who earned his fortune from sugar plantations on the Caribbean island of Nevis; The Royal Exchange in Glasgow now the Gallery of Modern Art, built by the city�۪s powerful tobacco lords who grew rich from plantations in the Americas; and Liverpool Town hall with its frieze showing lions, crocodiles, elephants and African faces was built as the centre of civic and mercantile activity.",2003_9_INTERVENTION,Intervention
